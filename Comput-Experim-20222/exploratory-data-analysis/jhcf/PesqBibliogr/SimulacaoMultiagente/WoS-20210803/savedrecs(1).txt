AB In this paper, we study the leaderless consensus problem for multiple Lagrangian systems in the presence of parametric uncertainties and external disturbances under directed graphs. To achieve asymptotic behavior, a robust continuous term with adaptive varying gains is added to alleviate the effects of the external disturbances with unknown bounds. In the case of a fixed directed graph, by introducing an integrate term in the auxiliary variable design, the final consensus equilibrium can be explicitly derived. We show that the agents achieve weighted average consensus, where the final equilibrium is dependent on three factors, namely, the interactive topology, the initial positions of the agents, and the control gains of the proposed control algorithm. In the case of switching directed graphs, a model-reference-adaptive-consensus-based algorithm is proposed such that the agents achieve leaderless consensus if the infinite sequence of switching graphs is uniformly jointly connected. Motivated by the fact that the relative velocity information is difficult to obtain accurately, we further propose a leaderless consensus algorithm with gain adaptation for multiple Lagrangian systems without using neighbors' velocity information. We also propose a model-reference-adaptive-consensus-based algorithm without using neighbors' velocity information for switching directed graphs. The proposed algorithms are distributed in the sense of using local information from its neighbors and using no common control gains. Numerical simulations are performed to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

AB This article presents the results of a methodology based on an extensive sociological fieldwork in three different sites settled along a gradient of aridity in Nigerien Sahel. This fieldwork led to build a set of rules for the behaviour of individuals in non-pastoralist villages. We implemented these rules into an agent-based model simulating three village archetypes. Each archetype includes biophysical, economical, social agricultural and livestock modules. Results from simulations with no social transition processes show that villages specialize themselves into different economic activities according to natural resource specificities: A decreasing intensification gradient is observed from the most favoured site, with more local productions and good ecological indicators, to the less-favoured site, with a growing proportion of the population wealth coming from migration remittances and "off-shore" livestock. Two family transition processes were implemented, following field observations and literature-based hypotheses: family organizations evolve between a patriarchal mode and a non-cooperative mode following tensions due to income redistribution. Family inheritance systems evolve from a "customary" one-heir mode to a "local Muslim" mode in which all males inherits land. This evolution depends on family tensions due to land availability. Once introducing these processes, the population of each site differentiates itself into specialized groups according to size, assets and social status. Meanwhile, the group proportions and specializations strongly vary according to the sites but they are all characterized by the emergence of individualistic family types and the increase of the village populations' robustness.

AB A two-spin system based on the idea used to formulate the dynamical model simulating the process of opinion spreading in a society, where people adopt one of the four social attitudes (2005 Physica A 351 593) is studied. The model is made of chains with two species of spins S and V at each site coupled by an insite interaction Mx303;0<i and interacting in different way with nearest (NN) and next-nearest (NNN) neighbors. The one-dimensional model with only NN interaction of the S spins and both NN and NNN interactions of the V spins (ACLS model) is analyzed. Using the linear renormalization group (LRG) the dependences of the specific heat and correlation functions on temperature and <(M)over tilde>(0) are calculated. The roles of the insite and NNN interactions are considered. The usefulness of the ACLS model to define stable states of the dynamical model describing opinion spreading in a society, which members represent four different attitudes to the level of freedom in two areas: personal and economic is discussed. It is pointed out that the difficulties in organizing modern societies can result from an internal conflict between these two areas.

ID MECHANISM
AB This paper presents a novel multiagent approach to automating taxi dispatch that services current bookings in a distributed fashion. The existing system in use by a taxi operator in Singapore and elsewhere, attempts to increase customer satisfaction locally, by sequentially dispatching nearby taxis to service customers. The proposed dispatch system attempts to increase customer satisfaction more globally, by concurrently dispatching multiple taxis to the same number of customers in the same geographical region, and vis-a-vis human driver satisfaction. To realize the system, a multiagent architecture is proposed, populated with software collaborative agents that can actively negotiate on behalf of taxi drivers in groups of size for available customer bookings. Theoretically, an analysis of the boundary and optimal multiagent taxi-dispatch situations is presented along with a discussion of their implications. Experimentally, the operational efficiency of the existing and proposed dispatch systems was evaluated through computer simulations. The empirical results, obtained for a 1000-strong taxi fleet over a discrete range of, show that the proposed system can dispatch taxis with reduction in customer waiting and empty taxi cruising times of up to 33.1% and 26.3%, respectively; and up to 41.8% and 41.2% reduction when a simple negotiation speedup heuristic was applied.
   Note to Practitioners-With the liberalization of the taxi industry in Singapore and elsewhere, keener competition among taxi operators has emerged. We believe the taxi operator that leads the competition will be the one with the best automated taxi dispatch system, offering the highest cost productivity and customer satisfaction. Our research is motivated by the increasing need for better automated approaches to match customer service requests and taxis, whose arrival and availability, respectively, might be sporadic or not known a priori. In this paper, we propose a novel multiagent system, called TuCab dispatch, to automate taxi dispatch in a distributed fashion. Our experiments for a 1000-strong taxi fleet show that TuCab dispatch can outperform existing centralized dispatch in terms of reduction in customer waiting and empty taxi cruising times, when both leverage on real-time traffic information for shortest-time path computation over a road network as proposed (Lee et al., 2004). Additionally, TuCab dispatch can be implemented on an existing technological infrastructure, providing the opportunities to harness the existing power of multiple intelligent transportation systems technologies. A more efficient dispatch system can help maintain a higher standard of customer service vis-a-vis human driver satisfaction, especially when the demand for taxi service is manageable for the fleet size. In future research, we will need to add more features and investigate their effectiveness towards achieving overall efficiency, including techniques to influence and better match the physical distributivity between service demand and available taxi supply in real-time.

AB Water reuse can serve as a sustainable alternative water source for urban areas. However, the successful implementation of large-scale water reuse projects depends on community acceptance. Because of the negative perceptions that are traditionally associated with reclaimed water, water reuse is often not considered in the development of urban water management plans. This study develops a simulation model for understanding community opinion dynamics surrounding the issue of water reuse, and how individual perceptions evolve within that context, which can help in the planning and decision-making process. Based on the social amplification of risk framework, our agent-based model simulates consumer perceptions, discussion patterns, and their adoption or rejection of water reuse. The model is based on the risk publics model, an empirical approach that uses the concept of belief clusters to explain the adoption of new technology. Each household is represented as an agent, and parameters that define their behavior and attributes are defined from survey data. Community-level parametersincluding social groups, relationships, and communication variables, also from survey dataare encoded to simulate the social processes that influence community opinion. The model demonstrates its capabilities to simulate opinion dynamics and consumer adoption of water reuse. In addition, based on empirical data, the model is applied to investigate water reuse behavior in different regions of the United States. Importantly, our results reveal that public opinion dynamics emerge differently based on membership in opinion clusters, frequency of discussion, and the structure of social networks.

ID OPINION DYNAMICS; EXTREMISM PROPAGATION; PATTERNS
AB Models of continuous opinion dynamics under bounded confidence show a sharp transition between a consensus and a polarization phase at a critical global bound of confidence. In this paper, heterogeneous bounds of confidence are studied. The surprising result is that a society of agents with two different bounds of confidence (open-and closed-minded agents) can find consensus even when both bounds of confidence are significantly below the critical bound of confidence of a homogeneous society. The phenomenon is shown by examples of agent-based simulation and by numerical computation of the time evolution of the agents density. The result holds for the bounded confidence model of Deffuant, Weisbuch, and others (Weisbuch et al., Complexity 2002, 7, 55-63), as well as for the model of Hegselmann and Krause (Hegselmann and Krause, Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation 2002, 5, 2). Thus, given an average level of confidence, diversity of bounds of confidence enhances the chances for consensus. The drawback of this enhancement is that opinion dynamics becomes suspect to severe drifts of clusters, where open-minded agents can pull closed-minded agents towards another cluster of closed-minded agents. A final consensus might thus not lie in the center of the opinion interval as it happens for uniform initial opinion distributions under homogeneous bounds of confidence. It can be located at extremal locations. This is demonstrated by example, which also show that the extension to heterogeneous bounds of confidence enriches the complexity of the dynamics tremendously. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Purpose
   The study aims to reveal regularities of collective decision in groups of varying cooperativity and to investigate the influence of individualism-collectivism cultural dimension on the emergence of collective behavioral entities.
   Design/methodology/approach
   An agent-based model of group behavior is used to simulate the logic of collective binary decisions defined by reaching a consensus threshold. The key parameter of the model is the cooperativity of interaction between individuals which locates the group in individualism-collectivism cultural dimension. The probabilities of collective decisions are measured as a function of individual preferences and the strength of cooperation between agents.
   Findings
   Strong, weak and middle point cooperativities of inter-individual interaction define three distinct regimes of collective decision logic, namely, individualism, conformism and criticality. The critical organization allows the group to generate coherent non-predetermined collective behavior in statistical agreement with individual preferences.
   Research limitations/implications
   Emergent collective behavior with coherent and nondeterministic decision-making can be modeled in an agent-based approach with local interaction between individuals tuned to a critical point. Variation of a single cooperativity parameter accounts for a continuous transition between organizations of the group inherent to inert matter and living systems.
   Social implications
   A new organization of social systems distinguished by internally relaxed relations and large-scale freedom is found beyond the traditional individualism-collectivism contraposition. This state is reached by tuning behavioral logic of individuals to a critical balance of individual and collective values.
   Originality/value
   Individualist, conformist and critical regimes of collective organization distinct in terms of integrity, complexity and determinism are recognized as universal organizational classes of nature spanning both inert and living systems. In particular, individualist and conformist regimes produce simple deterministic behavior typical for gases and solid bodies, whereas the critical organization generates complex nondeterministic behavior inherent to living organisms.

AB Rhombomys opimus (R. opimus), a social rodent, is the main reservoir host for zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL) in most parts of the Middle East and central Asia. The difficulties in monitoring rodent population patterns have hindered the effective application of preventive measures of ZCL. This study presents a spatially explicit agent-based simulation model of R. opimus behaviors that is integrated with Geographic Automata System (GAS) and a heuristic optimization method, cuckoo search (CS). The model is used to explore the relationships among rodent population dynamics, ZCL incidence and authority interventions using statistical data generated from simulated rodent societies rather than observational data, which are difficult to obtain through field surveys. The model simulation considers three agent types: rodents, colonies and cell agents. The model components and overall approach are calibrated, investigated with sensitivity analysis and validated with empirical field data in a ZCL-endemic area in Isfahan, central Iran. The results suggest that unsupervised and sporadic preventive measures could cause rodent emigration towards human population centers and start new waves of infections. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents a computational agent model capable of showing different types of social response patterns based on such mechanisms, adopted from theories on mirror neuron systems, emotion integration, emotion regulation, and empathy. The presented agent model provides a basis for humanlike social response patterns of virtual agents in the context of simulation-based training (e.g. for training of physicians or therapists), gaming, or for agent-based generation of virtual stories.

AB The simultaneous pharmaceutical analysis of multi-component drugs represents a challenge due to a large total number of analytes present in the sample. These analytes are not only the active pharmaceutical ingredients, but also the impurities that might follow the active substances. The aim of this study was to develop an efficient reversed-phase LC method for the simultaneous analysis of antiparkinsonian drugs levodopa, carbidopa and entacapone along with their six related impurities. For the achievement of desirable separation, different acids with anions possessing different properties according to Hofmeister classification (ortho-phosphoric, trifluoroacetic and perchloric acid) were tested. Finally, in order to draw the unbiased conclusions when optimizing the analytical method, for the final tuning of the gradient program, Box-Behnken experimental design and Derringer's desirability function were used. The experiments were performed on Zorbax Extend C18, 150 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 mu m particle size column with the UV detection at 280 nm and mobile phase flow rate of 1 mL/min. The optimal mobile phase consisted of methanol and 20 mM trifluoroacetic acid (pH 2.0 adjusted with NaOH), while their ratio is changed according to previously defined gradient program. The method was tested for selectivity, sensitivity, linearity, accuracy and precision, and proved to be suitable for routine qualitative and quantitative analysis of levodopa, carbidopa, entacapone and their impurities in their mixture.

AB In this note, synchronization for linearly coupled network is investigated by pinning a simple aperiodically intermittent controller. Nodes' dynamical behaviors in the network are described by continuous-time ordinary differential equations. Some sufficient conditions to guarantee global synchronization are presented. Furthermore, an adaptive algorithm is designed for the pinning control gain and its validity is also proved rigorously. Finally, numerical simulations are given to demonstrate the correctness of obtained results.

AB Human dynamics and sociophysics suggest statistical models that may explain and provide us with better insight into social phenomena. Here we tackle the problem of determining the distribution of the population density of a social space over time by modelling the dynamics of agents entering and exiting the space as a birth-death process. We show that, for a simple agent-based model in which the probabilities of entering and exiting the space depends on the number of agents currently present in the space, the population density of the space follows a gamma distribution. We also provide empirical evidence supporting the validity of the model by applying it to a data set of occupancy traces of a common space in an office building.

AB Segregation is widespread in all realms of human society. Several influential studies have argued that intolerance is not a prerequisite for a segregated society, and that segregation can arise even when people generally prefer diversity. We investigated this paradox experimentally, by letting groups of high-school students play four different real-time interactive games. Incentives for neighbor similarity produced segregation, but incentives for neighbor dissimilarity and neighborhood diversity prevented it. The participants continued to move while their game scores were below optimal, but their individual moves did not consistently take them to the best alternative position. These small differences between human and simulated agents produced different segregation patterns than previously predicted, thus challenging conclusions about segregation arising from these models.

ID EVOLUTIONARY ROBOTICS; PAIR BOND; HYPOTHESIS
AB Social coordination is studied in a simulated model of autonomous embodied agents that interact acoustically. Theoretical concepts concerning social behavior are presented from a systemic perspective and their usefulness is evaluated in interpreting the results obtained. Two agents moving in an unstructured arena must locate each other, and remain within a short distance of one another for as long as possible using noisy continuous acoustic interaction. Evolved dynamical recurrent neural networks are used as the control architecture. Acoustic coupling poses nontrivial problems lit discriminating 'self' from 'non-self' and structuring production of signals in time so as to minimize interference. Detailed observation of the most frequently evolved behavioral strategy shows that interacting agents perform rhythmic signals leading to the coordination of movement. During coordination, signals become entrained in an anti-phase mode that resembles turn-taking. Perturbation techniques show that signalling behavior not only performs an external function, but it is also integrated into the movement of the producing agent, thus showing the difficulty of separating behavior into social and non-social classes. Structural congruence between agents is shown by exploring internal dynamics as well as the response of single agents in the presence of signalling beacons that reproduce the signal patterns of the interacting agents. Lack of entrainment with the signals produced by the beacons shows the importance of transient periods of mutual dynamic perturbation wherein agents achieve congruence.

AB This paper models the dynamic process through which a large society may succeed in building up its 'social capital', i.e. a stable and dense pattern of interaction among its members. Agents play repeatedly an idiosyncratic Prisoner's Dilemma with their neighbors. The social network specifies not only the playing partners but, crucially, also determines how relevant strategic information diffuses or new cooperation opportunities are found. Search plays a key role because the environment is subject to payoff 'volatility' and, therefore, agents must continuously adapt to sustain high payoffs. In this context, we study how the architecture of the social network adapts to changes in the environment. We find that network strategic effects are important in enhancing cooperation. This in turn entails that, endogenously, the architecture of the social network adapts (by displaying more cohesiveness) when the environment deteriorates (say, becomes more volatile). These and other conclusions are first obtained by numerical simulations and then supported by approximate mean-field analysis. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved,

AB This paper reports on an experiment that investigates the effect of interacting with a personality-driven embodied conversational agent (ECA) on the perceived social presence and game experience of people in a VR social simulator. Furthermore, the dynamics between the different metrics of game experience and social presence of people are explored to determine which game experience metrics are the strongest predictors of perceived social presence in this context. A personality-based emotional model is used for personifying the employed ECA, which governs the manifestation of its non-verbal behaviors. Three experimental conditions manipulating the existence and intensity of non-verbal behaviors exhibited by the ECA were used to investigate the effect of this proposed approach. The results of the experiment with 41 participants indicate that people who were exposed to an extrovert ECA experienced significantly higher levels of behavioral involvement as part of their social presence compared to the other conditions. These results suggest that incorporating personality by means of non-verbal behavior in the emotional model of an ECA influences users perceived feeling of social presence. Furthermore, our results reveal that there is a bidirectional relationship between game experience metrics and perceived social presence of people as each predict the other.

AB An agent-based social simulation is one way to add a story to simulated game universes within the game mechanics while preserving the autonomy of nonplay characters (NPCs). In this paper, we add a social reasoning element behind NPC actions to make their plans more story like. An AI planner is developed to combine plan search and logic inference about others' minds. An NPC agent equipped with the planner uses actions to change others' minds, and uses such mental changes to achieve its goal. We review the question of whether stories do arise from agent-based simulations by examining actual narrative segments generated by our NPC agents, and by an experimental exploration of the frequencies and lengths of narrative segments. A story facilitator, named divine intervention operator service (DIOS), makes stories happen when they are impossible via on-the-fly adjustment of character personalities.

The social scientific approach is one of the promising methods to facilitate effective operation for the resource allocation problems in manufacturing systems, since the approach takes an analogy of social systems which are optimal and robust in nature. In this paper, the authors first propose a modeling methodology for an oligopolistic virtual market, and develop an oligopolistic virtual market as an experimental model. Then they clarify several important characteristics of the oligopolistic virtual market by computer simulation experiments, and try to apply the proposed method into a utility computing operational problem to validate its effectiveness into resource allocation problems.

AB The Calcium ion Ca2+ plays a critical role as an initiator and preserving agent of the cross-bridge cycle in the force generation of skeletal muscle. A new multi-scale chemo-mechanical model is presented in order to analyze the role of Ca2+ in muscle fatigue and to predict fatigue behavior. To this end, a cross-bridge kinematic model was incorporated in a continuum based mechanical model, considering a thermodynamic compatible framework. The contractile velocity and the generated active force were directly related to the force-bearing states that were considered for the cross-bridge cycle. In order to determine the values of the model parameters, the output results of an isometric simulation were initially fitted with experimental data obtained for rabbit Extensor Digitorum Longus muscle. Furthermore, a simulated force-velocity curve under concentric contractions was compared with reported experimental results. Finally, by varying the Ca2+ concentration level and its kinetics in the tissue, the model was able to predict the evolution of the active force of an experimental fatigue protocol. The good agreement observed between the simulated results and the experimental outcomes proves the ability of the model to reproduce the fatigue behavior and its applicability for more detailed multidisciplinary investigations related to chemical conditions in muscle performance.

AB To address the complex nature of cancer occurrence and outcomes, approaches have been developed to simultaneously assess the role of two or more etiologic agents within hierarchical levels including the: (i) macroenvironment level (e.g., health care policy, neighborhood, or family structure); (ii) individual level (e.g., behaviors, carcinogenic exposures, socioeconomic factors, and psychologic responses); and (iii) biologic level (e.g., cellular biomarkers and inherited susceptibility variants). Prior multilevel approaches tend to focus on social and environmental hypotheses, and are thus limited in their ability to integrate biologic factors into a multilevel framework. This limited integration may be related to the limited translation of research findings into the clinic. We propose a "Multi-level Biologic and Social Integrative Construct" (MBASIC) to integrate macroenvironment and individual factors with biology. The goal of this framework is to help researchers identify relationships among factors that may be involved in the multifactorial, complex nature of cancer etiology, to aid in appropriate study design, to guide the development of statistical or mechanistic models to study these relationships, and to position the results of these studies for improved intervention, translation, and implementation. MBASIC allows researchers from diverse fields to develop hypotheses of interest under a common conceptual framework, to guide transdisciplinary collaborations, and to optimize the value of multilevel studies for clinical and public health activities.

TI Effects of pathogen dependency in a multi-pathogen infectious disease

AB Background: Increased computational resources have made individual based models popular for modelling epidemics. They have the advantage of incorporating heterogeneous features, including realistic population structures (like e.g. households). Existing stochastic simulation studies of epidemics, however, have been developed mainly for incorporating single pathogen scenarios although the effect of different pathogens might directly or indirectly (e.g. via contact reductions) effect the spread of each pathogen. The goal of this work was to simulate a stochastic agent based system incorporating the effect of multiple pathogens, accounting for the household based transmission process and the dependency among pathogens.
   Methods: With the help of simulations from such a system, we observed the behaviour of the epidemics in different scenarios. The scenarios included different household size distributions, dependency versus independency of pathogens, and also the degree of dependency expressed through household isolation during symptomatic phase of individuals. Generalized additive models were used to model the association between the epidemiological parameters of interest on the variation in the parameter values from the simulation data. All the simulations and statistical analyses were performed using R 3.4.0.
   Results: We demonstrated the importance of considering pathogen dependency using two pathogens, and showing the difference when considered independent versus dependent. Additionally for the general scenario with more pathogens, the assumption of dependency among pathogens and the household size distribution in the population cohort was found to be effective in containing the epidemic process. Additionally, populations with larger household sizes reached the epidemic peak faster than societies with smaller household sizes but dependencies among pathogens did not affect this outcome significantly. Larger households had more infections in all population cohort examples considered in our simulations. Increase in household isolation coefficient for pathogen dependency also could control the epidemic process.
   Conclusion: Presence of multiple pathogens and their interaction can impact the behaviour of an epidemic across cohorts with different household size distributions. Future household cohort studies identifying multiple pathogens will provide useful data to verify the interaction processes in such an infectious disease system.

AB We present a computer model of opinion changes in a scientific community. The study takes into account two mechanisms of opinion formation for individual scientists: influence of coworkers with whom there is direct interaction and cumulative influence of the subject literature. We analyze the evolution of relative popularity of different competing theories, depending on their accuracy in describing observed phenomena and on current social support of the theory. We include such aspects as finite lifetime of publication impact and tendency to 'defend' one's own opinions, especially if they were already published. A special class of publications, delivering crucial observational or experimental data, which may revolutionize the scientific worldview is considered. The goal of the model is to discover which conditions lead to quick domination of one theory over others, or, conversely, in which situations one may expect several explanations to co-exist.

AB This article investigates the complex relationship between endogenous and exogenous, deterministic and stochastic stimulating factors in public opinion dynamics. An asynchronous multiagent network model is proposed to explore the interaction mechanism between individual opinions and the public opinion in online multiagent network community, including both the micro and the macro patterns of opinion evolution. In addition, based on random network models, a novel algorithm is provided for opinion evolution prediction. The model property analysis and numerical experiments show that the proposed asynchronous multiagent network model can assimilate and explain some interesting phenomena that are observed in the real world. Further case studies with numerical simulation and real-world applications confirm the feasibility and flexibility of the proposed model in public opinion analysis. The results challenge the common perception that mass media or opinion facilitators play the fundamental role in controlling the development trends of public opinion. This study shows that the formation and evolution of public opinion in the presence of opinion leaders depend also on an individual's emotional inertia and conformity pressures from peers in the same topic group.

AB Agent-based simulation modeling enables the construction of formal models that simultaneously can be microvalidated against accounts of individual behavior and macrovalidated against aggregate data that show the characteristics of many socially derived time series. These characteristics ( leptokurtosis and clustered volatility) have two important consequences: first, they also appear in suitably structured agent-based models where, like real social actors, agents are socially embedded and metastable; second, their presence precludes the use of many standard statistical techniques like the chi-square test. These characteristics in time-series data indicate that a suitable agent-based model rather than a standard statistical model will be appropriate. This is illustrated with an agent-based model of mutual social influence on domestic water demand. The consequences for many frequently used statistical techniques are discussed.

AB Understanding exchange is essential for understanding past societies. The exchange of knowledge and goods undeniably influenced the development of Pueblo culture. Previous studies within Southwestern archaeology have mostly focused on the exchange of material goods such as ceramics or prestige items since these items do not decay, while other day-to-day exchanges, such as the exchange of food items, are relatively undetectable in archaeology. Sahlins (1972) notes that in small-scale societies, food exchange is essential for the survival of individuals in patchy landscapes. Moreover, Sahlins's research shows that cross-culturally in small-scale societies, the exchange of food is one of the fundamental structuring mechanisms for alliances. With this knowledge, we may want to study the exchange of food within societies, but without being able to see the actual exchange, how can archaeologists explore the impact of food exchange given the relatively sparse archaeological record? In this paper, I use computer simulation to explore the extent to which food-sharing practices would have been instrumental for the survival of Ancestral Pueblo people across the patchy landscape of the Prehispanic American Southwest and suggest that we can see direct evidence of exchange through the aggregation of households into clustered settlements. Social networks would have created stable bonds among these exchanging individuals, further helping the survival of those individuals and their progeny. Specifically, I engage Sahlins's notion of balanced reciprocal exchange networks (BRN; when unrelated individuals rely upon reputation building to inform exchange relationships) within the experimental test-bed of the Village Ecodynamics Project's agent-based simulation.

ID ATTITUDE
AB A simulation model that represents belief change within a population of agents who are connected by a social network is presented based on Thagard's theory of explanatory coherence. In this model there are a fixed number of represented beliefs, each of which are either held or not by each agent. These are conceived of existing against a background of a large set of (unrepresented) shared beliefs. These beliefs are to different extents coherent with each other - this is modeled using a coherence function from possible sets of core beliefs to [-1, 1]. The social influence is achieved through gaining of a belief across a social link. Beliefs can be lost by being dropped from an agent's store. Both of these processes happen with a probability related to the change in coherence that would result in an agent's belief store. A resulting measured "opinion" can be retrieved in a number of ways, here as a weighted sum of a pattern of the core beliefs - opinion is thus an outcome and not directly processed by agents. This model suggests hypotheses about group opinion dynamics that differ from that of many established models.

AB Aerial robotic swarms have shown benefits for performing search and surveillance missions in open spaces in the past. Among other properties, these systems are robust, scalable and adaptable to different scenarios. In this work, we propose a behavior-based algorithm to carry out a surveillance task in a rectangular area with a flexible number of quadcopters, flying at different speeds. Once the efficiency of the algorithm is quantitatively analyzed, the robustness of the system is demonstrated with 3 different tests: loss of broadcast messages, positioning errors, and failure of half of the agents during the mission. Experiments are carried out in an indoor arena with micro quadcopters to support simulation results. Finally, a case study is proposed to show a realistic implementation in the test bed.

AB Stochastic actor-based models for network dynamics have the primary aim of statistical inference about processes of network change, but may be regarded as a kind of agent-based models. Similar to many other agent-based models, they are based on local rules for actor behavior. Different from many other agent-based models, by including elements of generalized linear statistical models they aim to be realistic detailed representations of network dynamics in empirical data sets. Statistical parallels to micro-macro considerations can be found in the estimation of parameters determining local actor behavior from empirical data, and the assessment of goodness of fit from the correspondence with network-level descriptives. This article studies several network-level consequences of dynamic actor-based models applied to represent cross-sectional network data. Two examples illustrate how network-level characteristics can be obtained as emergent features implied by microspecifications of actor-based models.

AB Particle swarm optimization is a novel swarm-intelligence-based algorithm and a valid optimization technique. However, the algorithm suffers from the premature convergence problem when facing to complex optimization problem. In order to keep the balance between the global exploration and the local exploitation validly, the paper develops a knowledge-based cooperative particle swarm optimization (KCPSO). KCPSO mainly simulates the self-cognitive and self-learning process of evolutionary agents in special environment, and introduces a knowledge billboard to record varieties of search information. Moreover, KCPSO takes advantage of multi-swarm to maintain the swarm diversity and tries to guide their evolution by the shared information. Under the guide of the shared information, KCPSO manipulates each sub-swarm to go on with local exploitation in different local area, in which every particle follows a social learning behavior mode; at the same time, KCPSO carries out the global exploration through the escaping behavior and the cooperative behavior of the particles in different sub-swarms. KCPSO can maintain appropriate swarm diversity and alleviate the premature convergence validly. The proposed model was applied to some well-known benchmarks. The relative experimental results show KCPSO is a robust global optimization method for the complex multimodal functions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper explores the notion of 'degree of embodiment' within the context of autonomous agent research, specifically within swarms of virtual robotic agents. Swarms of virtual robots with systematically varied degrees of embodiment are designed and implemented, and a 3D world created for them. Experimental simulations are then carried out wherein groups of these robots perform swarm tasks, and levels of performance for each group are measured and analysed. Analysis of this data suggests that there is no simple linear or monotonic correlation between degree of agent embodiment and swarm performance (in this particular virtual environment), but rather that an 'ideal' degree of embodiment exists to create a superior swarm behaviour for a given task in a given environment.

AB In this paper, the event-triggered consensus problem of multiagent systems with input time delay is investigated. First, the normal event-triggered control scheme containing the input time delay is introduced to reduce the number of communication. Then the following results are achieved: 1) the procedure of setting parameters is carefully formulated for the event-triggered control scheme; 2) the precise input time delay margin is calculated for the event-triggered consensus of the multiagent systems; 3) a more general condition of constructing event-triggered functions is derived to exclude the Zeno behavior; 4) the self-triggered control scheme is further applied to avoid the continuous measurement; and 5) the observer-based control scheme is also utilized to tackle the problem of unmeasurable state. Finally, the correctness and the effectiveness of these results are demonstrated by numerical simulations.

AB For survival and development, autonomous agents in complex adaptive systems involving the human society must compete against or collaborate with others for sharing limited resources or wealth, by using different methods. One method is to invest, in order to obtain payoffs with risk. It is a common belief that investments with a positive risk-return relationship (namely, high risk high return and vice versa) are dominant over those with a negative risk-return relationship (i.e., high risk low return and vice versa) in the human society; the belief has a notable impact on daily investing activities of investors. Here we investigate the risk-return relationship in a model complex adaptive system, in order to study the effect of both market efficiency and closeness that exist in the human society and play an important role in helping to establish traditional finance/economics theories. We conduct a series of computer-aided human experiments, and also perform agent-based simulations and theoretical analysis to confirm the experimental observations and reveal the underlying mechanism. We report that investments with a negative risk-return relationship have dominance over those with a positive risk-return relationship instead in such a complex adaptive systems. We formulate the dynamical process for the system's evolution, which helps to discover the different role of identical and heterogeneous preferences. This work might be valuable not only to complexity science, but also to finance and economics, to management and social science, and to physics.

AB Social networks have become an important part of agent-based models, and their structure may have remarkable impact on simulation results. We propose a simple and efficient but empirically based approach for spatial agent-based models which explicitly takes into account restrictions and opportunities imposed by effects of baseline homophily, i.e. the influence of local socio-demography on the composition of one's social network. Furthermore, the algorithm considers the probability of links that depends on geographical distance between potential partners.
   The resulting network reflects social settings and furthermore allows the modeller to influence network properties by adjusting agent type specific parameters. Especially the parameter for distance dependence and the probability of distant links allow for control of clustering and agent type distribution of personal networks.

AB Agent Based Modelling (ABM), a promising scientific toolset, has received criticism from some, in part, due to a claimed lack of scientific rigour, especially in the communication of its methods and results. To test the veracity of these claims, we conduct a structured analysis of over 900 scientific objects (figures, tables, or equations) that arose from 128 ABM papers published in the Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation (JASSS), during the period 2001 to 2012 inclusive. Regrettably, we find considerable evidence in support of the detractors of ABM as a scientific enterprise: elementary plotting attributes are left off more often than not; basic information such as the number of replicates or the basis behind a particular statistic are not included; and few, if any, established methodological communication standards are apparent. In short, 'anarchy reigns'. Whilst the study was confined only to ABM papers of JASSS, we conclude that if the ABM community wishes its approach to be accepted further afield, authors, reviewers, and editors should take the results of our work as a wake-up call.

AB Recent advancements in local methods have significantly improved the collision avoidance behavior of virtual characters. However, existing methods fail to take into account that in real life pedestrians tend to walk in small groups, consisting mainly of pairs or triples of individuals. We present a novel approach to simulate the walking behavior of such small groups. Our model describes how group members interact with each other, with other groups and individuals. We highlight the potential of our method through a wide range of test-case scenarios. We evaluate the results from our simulations using a number of quantitative quality metrics, and also provide visual and numerical comparisons with video footages of real crowds.

ID LINEAR MULTIAGENT SYSTEMS; QUADROTOR
AB The randomly switching communication topologies are of particular interest for researchers in the field of consensus control since the communication connection among multiple agents can randomly change with time and space. Following this pattern, this paper models the communication topology with the Markovian randomly switching graphs, since the Markovian chain process is usually used to model the network with Rayleigh fading channel. In this stochastic framework, this paper focuses on the consensus control and performance improvement problems of grouped agents with linear or linearized nominal dynamics. To solve this problem, a class of state-feedback controllers is proposed under the assumption that all the state measurements are available. These controllers are intrinsically distributed since they solely require the relative information between neighboring agents. Moreover, the notion of stochastic consensus region integrated with transient performance is defined to measure the robustness of the proposed controllers with respect to the communication topologies. This paper theoretically shows that these controllers yield unbounded consensus region, which implies that they are well-designed. Furthermore, these controllers can improve the $\mathcal consensus, and transient performances of agents subject to external and initial-state disturbances. At the end of this paper, numerical simulations and experiments are performed to verify the theoretical results.

AB To understand how interpersonal agreements can be generated within complexly differentiated social systems, we develop an agent-based computational model of negotiation in which social influence plays a key role in the attainment of social and cognitive integration. The model reflects a view of social influence that is predicated on the interactions among such factors as the agents' cognition, their abilities to initiate and maintain social behaviour, as well as the structural patterns of social relations in which influence unfolds. Findings from a set of computer simulations of the model show that the degree to which agents are influenced depends on the network of relations in which they are located, on the order in which interactions occur, and on the type of information that these interactions convey. We also find that a fundamental role in explaining influence is played by how inclined the agents are to be conciliatory with each other, how accurate their beliefs are, and how self-confident they are in dealing with their social interactions. Moreover, the model provides insights into the trade-offs typically involved in the exercise of social influence. 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Underlying the aggregate phenomena of persistent problems such as urban sprawl and spatial socioeconomic disparity is the individual choice of where to live. This study develops an agent-based model to simulate social and economic influences on neighborhood choice. With Danville, Illinois, as an empirical context, a pattern-oriented approach is employed to examine the role of social ties in shaping intraurban household mobility. In the model, household agents decide whether and where to relocate within the community based on factors such as neighborhood attractiveness, affordability, and the density of a household's social network in the prospective block group. Social network and neighborhood choices are encoded with logit utility functions. The relative influence of factors affecting the formation of social ties in the simulated social network, such as geographic proximity, similarity of income, race, and presence of children, are adjusted using parameter variation to create alternative model settings. Simulated migration patterns resulting from different network and neighborhood choice coefficients are compared with observed migration patterns over a two-year period. Based on 1,000 simulation experiments, a regression of homeowner migration error (the difference between simulated and observed migration) relative to the parameter settings revealed components of social network choice such as income, race, and probability of local ties to be significant in matching observed migration patterns. A nonlinear effect of simulated social networks on household mobility and thus migration error was exhibited in this study.

AB Predictions which invoke evolutionary mechanisms are hard to test. Agent-based modeling in artificial life offers a way to simulate behaviors and interactions in specific physical or social environments over many generations. The outcomes have implications for understanding adaptive value of behaviors in context. Pain-related behavior in animals is communicated to other animals that might protect or help, or might exploit or predate. An agent-based model simulated the effects of displaying or not displaying pain (expresser/nonexpresser strategies) when injured and of helping, ignoring, or exploiting another in pain (altruistic/nonaltruistic/selfish strategies). Agents modeled in MATLAB interacted at random while foraging (gaining energy); random injury interrupted foraging for a fixed time unless help from an altruistic agent, who paid an energy cost, speeded recovery. Environmental and social conditions also varied, and each model ran for 10,000 iterations. Findings were meaningful in that, in general, contingencies that evident from experimental work with a variety of mammals, over a few interactions, were replicated in the agent-based model after selection pressure over many generations. More energy-demanding expression of pain reduced its frequency in successive generations, and increasing injury frequency resulted in fewer expressers and altruists. Allowing exploitation of injured agents decreased expression of pain to near zero, but altruists remained. Decreasing costs or increasing benefits of helping hardly changed its frequency, whereas increasing interaction rate between injured agents and helpers diminished the benefits to both. Agent-based modeling allows simulation of complex behaviors and environmental pressures over evolutionary time.

AB Collective decision making involves on the one hand individual mental states such as beliefs, emotions and intentions, and on the other hand interaction with others with possibly different mental states. Achieving a satisfactory common group decision on which all agree requires that such mental states are adapted to each other by social interaction. Recent developments in social neuroscience have revealed neural mechanisms by which such mutual adaptation can be realised. These mechanisms not only enable intentions to converge to an emerging common decision, but at the same time enable to achieve shared underlying individual beliefs and emotions. This paper presents a computational model for such processes. As an application of the model, an agent-based analysis was made of patterns in crowd behaviour, in particular to simulate a real-life incident that took place on May 4, 2010 in Amsterdam. From available video material and witness reports, useful empirical data were extracted. Similar patterns were achieved in simulations, whereby some of the parameters of the model were tuned to the case addressed, and most parameters were assigned default values. The results show the inclusion of contagion of belief, emotion, and intention states of agents results in better reproduction of the incident than non-inclusion.

AB Fuzzy Logic is a framework particularly useful to formalise and deal with imprecise concepts and statements expressed in natural language. This paper has three related aims. First, it aims to provide a short introduction to the basics of Fuzzy Logic within the context of social simulation. Secondly, it presents a well-documented NetLogo extension that facilitates the use of Fuzzy Logic within NetLogo. Finally, by providing a concrete example, it shows how researchers can use the Fuzzy Logic extension to build agent-based models in which individual agents hold their own fuzzy concepts and use their own fuzzy rules, which may also change over time. We argue that Fuzzy Logic and the tools provided here can be useful in Social Simulation in different ways. For example, they can assist in the process of analysing the robustness of a certain social theory expressed in natural language to different specifications of the imprecise concepts that the theory may contain (such as e.g. "wealthy", "poor" or "disadvantaged"). They can also facilitate the exploration of the effect that heterogeneity in concept interpretations may have in a society (i.e. the significance of the fact that different people may have different interpretations of the same concept). Thus, this paper and the tools included in it can make the endeavour of translating social theories into computer programs easier and also more rigorous.

AB Two separate research lines have shown that (1) infants expect agents to move efficiently toward goal states and that (2) infants navigate the social world selectively, preferring some individuals to others and attributing social preferences to others' agents. Here, we studied how the expectation of efficient actions influences infants' looking preferences and their inferences about others' preferences. We presented 15-month-olds with a set of videos containing three geometric figures depicting social agents. One of them (observer) watched how the other two agents acted to obtain a reward. Critically, the efficiency of their actions was manipulated. One agent reached the reward taking a direct efficient path (efficient agent), whereas the other agent took a curvilinear inefficient path (inefficient agent). At test, the observer approached each of them in two separate trials. Infants looked longer at the screen when the observer approached the inefficient agent rather than the efficient agent. In addition, infants showed a bias to track the actions of the efficient agent when efficient and inefficient agents acted simultaneously. In a second experiment, we rejected the possibility that infants' expectations in Experiment 1 resulted from differences in the movement repertoire of the agents. The results suggest that the principle of efficiency tunes infants' attention towards agents who previously acted efficiently rather than inefficiently and it guides infants' expectations in third-party scenarios- infants are surprised when a third agent approaches an agent who in the past acted inefficiently.

AB Interactions between people are the basis on which the structure of our society arises as a complex system and, at the same time, are the starting point of any physical description of it. In the last few years, much theoretical research has addressed this issue by combining the physics of complex networks with a description of interactions in terms of evolutionary game theory. We here take this research a step further by introducing a most salient societal factor such as the individuals' preferences, a characteristic that is key to understanding much of the social phenomenology these days. We consider a heterogeneous, agent-based model in which agents interact strategically with their neighbors, but their preferences and payoffs for the possible actions differ. We study how such a heterogeneous network behaves under evolutionary dynamics and different strategic interactions, namely coordination games and best shot games. With this model we study the emergence of the equilibria predicted analytically in random graphs under best response dynamics, and we extend this test to unexplored contexts like proportional imitation and scale free networks. We show that some theoretically predicted equilibria do not arise in simulations with incomplete information, and we demonstrate the importance of the graph topology and the payoff function parameters for some games. Finally, we discuss our results with the available experimental evidence on coordination games, showing that our model agrees better with the experiment than standard economic theories, and draw hints as to how to maximize social efficiency in situations of conflicting preferences.

AB This paper presents a theory for role-playing simulation games intended to support analysts (and trainees) with generating and testing alternative competing hypotheses on how to influence world conflict situations. Simulated leaders and followers capable of playing these games are implemented in a cognitive modeling framework, called the Performance Moderator Function Server (PMFserv), which covers value systems, personality and cultural factors, emotions, relationships, perception, stress/coping style, and decision making. Of direct interest, as Section I-A explains, is codification and synthesis of best-of-breed social-science models within PMFserv to improve the internal validity of agent implementations. Sections II and III present this for leader profiling instruments and group-membership decision making, respectively. Section IV then offers two real-world case studies (The Third Crusade and SE Asia Today) where agent models are subjected to Turing and correspondence tests under each case study. In sum, substantial effort off game realism, best-of-breed social-science models, and agent validation efforts is essential if analysis and training tools are to help explore cultural issues and alternative ways to influence outcomes. Such exercises, in turn, are likely to improve the state of the science as well.

AB In many experimental setups in social-sciences, psychology and economy the subjects are requested to accept or dispense monetary compensation which is usually given in discrete units. Using computer and mathematical modeling we show that in the framework of studying the dynamics of acceptance of proposals in the ultimatum game, the long time dynamics of acceptance of offers in the game are completely different for discrete vs. continuous offers. For discrete values the dynamics follow an exponential behavior. However, for continuous offers the dynamics are described by a power-law. This is shown using an agent based computer simulation as well as by utilizing an analytical solution of a mean-field equation describing the model. These findings have implications to the design and interpretation of socio-economical experiments beyond the ultimatum game. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Collective intelligence, an emergent phenomenon in which a composite system of multiple interacting agents performs at levels greater than the sum of its parts, has long compelled research efforts in social and behavioral sciences. To date, however, formal models of collective intelligence have lacked a plausible mathematical description of the relationship between local-scale interactions between autonomous sub-system components (individuals) and global-scale behavior of the composite system (the collective). In this paper we use the Active Inference Formulation (AIF), a framework for explaining the behavior of any non-equilibrium steady state system at any scale, to posit a minimal agent-based model that simulates the relationship between local individual-level interaction and collective intelligence. We explore the effects of providing baseline AIF agents (Model 1) with specific cognitive capabilities: Theory of Mind (Model 2), Goal Alignment (Model 3), and Theory of Mind with Goal Alignment (Model 4). These stepwise transitions in sophistication of cognitive ability are motivated by the types of advancements plausibly required for an AIF agent to persist and flourish in an environment populated by other highly autonomous AIF agents, and have also recently been shown to map naturally to canonical steps in human cognitive ability. Illustrative results show that stepwise cognitive transitions increase system performance by providing complementary mechanisms for alignment between agents' local and global optima. Alignment emerges endogenously from the dynamics of interacting AIF agents themselves, rather than being imposed exogenously by incentives to agents' behaviors (contra existing computational models of collective intelligence) or top-down priors for collective behavior (contra existing multiscale simulations of AIF). These results shed light on the types of generic information-theoretic patterns conducive to collective intelligence in human and other complex adaptive systems.

AB We study agents in a social network who learn by observing the actions of their neighbors. The agents iteratively estimate an unknown 'state of the world' s from initial private signals, and the past actions of their neighbors in the social network.
   First, we consider a set of Bayesian agents, and investigate the computational problem the agents face in implementing the (myopic) Bayesian decision rule. When private signals are independent conditioned on s, and when the social network graph is a tree, we provide a new 'dynamic cavity algorithm' for the agents' calculations, with computational effort that is exponentially lower than what is currently known. We use our algorithm to perform the first numerical simulations of interacting Bayesian agents on networks with hundreds of nodes.
   Second, we investigate a different model of social learning, with naive agents who practice 'majority dynamics', i.e., at each round adopt the majority opinion of their neighbors. Under mild conditions, we show that under majority dynamics, agents learn s with probability 1 - epsilon in O(log log(1/epsilon)) rounds.
   We conjecture that on d-regular trees, myopic Bayesian agents learn s as quickly as agents who practice majority dynamics. Using our algorithm for Bayesian agents, the conjecture implies that the computational effort required of Bayesian agents to learn s is only polylogarithmic in 1/epsilon on d-regular trees. Thus, our results challenge the belief that iterative Bayesian learning is computationally intractable.

AB This paper addresses the finite-time formation tracking control problem for multiple rigid bodies whose dynamics are defined on the matrix Lie groups, including the special Euclidean group SE(2),SE(3) as specific cases. The reference trajectory in a form of rotational and translational motions is generated offline in advance as the virtual leader for tracking. Moreover, the formation time is specified according to the task, and the desired formation shape is given a priori with respect to the virtual leader. By virtue of the system decomposition approach, intrinsic formation tracking laws are derived for arbitrary initial velocities for the rigid bodies. The tracking controllers are intrinsic meaning that the dynamics and controllers are developed in the body-fixed frame without a global reference frame. Moreover, based on the geometric convex combination on SE(3), the result is extended to the distributed case where only the neighboring agents' state are used. Two numerical simulations on SE(2) and SE(3) are given respectively to illustrate the validity and robustness of the proposed controllers. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Objectives The aim of this study was to analyse the impact of different clinical conditioning approaches and an ammonium polyfluoride- and trimethoxysilylpropyl methacrylate-based experimental primer for intraoral luting of buccal tubes on silica-based ceramic surfaces. Materials and methods A total of 60 leucite-reinforced glass ceramic molar crowns were conditioned using different methods (n = 10): I-roughening, hydrofluoric acid, silane; II-roughening, silane; III-roughening, experimental coupling agent; IV-experimental coupling agent; V-roughening; VI-no treatment. A buccal tube was adhesively luted to the ceramic surface. Subsequently, water storage, thermocycling and chewing simulation were carried out. The shear bond strength (SBS) was determined, and changes in the surface were assessed. Results All tubes of the control group (group VI) debonded after incubation. The conditioning methods using coupling agents revealed mean values for SBS of 61.56 MPa (group I), 45.53 MPa (group III), 41.65 MPa (group II), and 23.14 MPa (group IV). In groups I-III, both composite residues and cracks/tear-outs were detected. Conclusions The conditioning of silicate ceramic surfaces with a suitable coupling agent system appears to allow sufficient adhesive luting of buccal tubes. The intraoral luting of fixed appliance elements on silicate ceramic surfaces using an ammonium polyfluoride- and trimethoxysilylpropyl methacrylate-based ceramic primer can withstand orthodontic forces.

AB A two-step agent-based mathematical model of negative rumor spread in the context of conflicting groups is presented. The GBN-Dialogue model builds on rumor theory, focuses on person-to-person interaction characteristics, and is dynamical. The model first estimates the probability of rumor transmission between two persons based on their transmission motivation (which is a function of their Group (G) memberships), the strengths of their belief (B) in the rumor, and the Novelty (N) of the rumor for each person. Psychological and sociological research informs this Transmission Probability Function. In the second step, belief levels and rumor novelty of each participant change as a result of rumor transmission and time; literature on attitude change guides these updating functions. Empirical support is presented by comparing rumor transmission literature with results of Monte Carlo simulations on different network topologies. The validity of the model's assumptions is addressed by comparison with simpler and more complex alternatives.

AB The acid buffering capacity of an estuary is directly proportional to the volume of buffering agents within the system. In areas with limited upstream inflows of buffering agents, the primary buffering agents are sourced from the diffusion of marine constituents. During dry periods the buffering capacity increases with tidal diffusion, whereas buffering decreases following estuarine flushing from high inflows. In acid sulphate soil environments, acidic discharges are generated immediately following rainfall events. Thereby, the diffusion of buffering agents throughout an estuary plays an important role in sustaining biogeochemical processes. Prediction of the transport and buffering dynamics of acidic plumes within estuaries allows severely impacted acid areas to be identified and catchment management strategies developed. To simulate acid transport and tidal buffering processes within an estuary, a numerical model was modified and an acidic buffering module included within the hydrodynamic routine. An estuarine wide case study was then undertaken to demonstrate the effectiveness of the acid plume module in simulating onsite conditions and the role of buffering versus dilution. Acid discharged from the study domain, located on a tidal barrier estuary in south-eastern Australia, was monitored using fixed and boat mounted instrumentation to track far-field plume behaviour. The acidic plume monitoring results were converted to hydrogen proton concentrations and included within the water quality module to simulate acid buffering with bicarbonate ions diffusing from the marine boundary. The validated model can be applied to single or multi-drain estuary networks to assess possible management options for reducing the impact of acid plume events. This enables the most effective management approach to be identified and assists in prioritising acid sulphate soil sites for remediation. This is particularly useful to natural resource managers in order to assess remediation sites that have the most environmental impact, or can be most effectively buffered, via model scenario tests.

AB This paper interprets a particular agent-based social simulation (ABSS) in terms of Conte's third way of understanding agent-based simulation. It is proposed that the normalized compression distance (derived from estimates of Kolmogorov complexity) between the initial and final macrolevel states of the ABSS provides a quantitative measure of the degree to which the results obtained via the ABSS might be obtained via a closed-form expression. If the final macrolevel state of an ABSS can only be obtained by simulation, this confers on agent-based social simulations a special status. Future empirical (computational) work and epistemological analyses are proposed.

AB Cyberbalkanization has been observed in some online activities, but its mechanism remains uncertain. Drawing on the Social Balance Theory, we theorized that the formation of "mutual ignoring" triads (three actors in a group with only a pair of interacts) in a network is a key procedure for cyberbalkanization. A cyberbalkanized network was constructed using data shared on Facebook Pages during the 2014 Hong Kong protests. Our findings indicate "mutual ignoring" was a prominent triad network configuration, whereas no such configuration was found in randomly generated networks. Our empirical-based observation was retested with simulation by agent-based model, confirming that "mutual ignoring" is essential for the emergence of cyberbalkanization. A strategy is then suggested to minimize cyberbalkanization.

AB Sociolinguistic studies have demonstrated that centrally-connected and peripheral. members of social networks can both propel and impede the spread of linguistic innovations. We use agent-based computer simulations to investigate the dynamic properties of these network roles in a large social influence network, in which diffusion is modeled as the probabilistic uptake of one of several competing variants by agents of unequal social standing. We find that highly-connected agents, structural equivalents of leaders in empirical studies, advance on-going change by spreading competing variants. Isolated agents, or loners, holding on to existing variants are safe-keepers of variants considered old or new depending on the current state of the rest of the population. Innovations spread following a variety of S-curves and stabilize as norms in the network only if two conditions are simultaneously satisfied: (1) the network comprises extremely highly connected and very isolated agents, and (2) agents are biased to pay proportionally more attention to better connected, or popular, neighbors. These findings reconcile competing models of individual network roles in the selection and propagation process of language change, and support Bloomfield's hypothesis that the spread of linguistic innovations in heterogeneous social networks depend upon communication density and relative prestige.

AB Multi-dimensional blast furnace operation simulator based on multi-fluid theory and reaction kinetics is applied to the novel operations of blast furnace. The effective use of carbon composite agglomerates (CCB) in blast furnace is expected to have several advantages to improve furnace efficiency. In this study, mathematical expression of reduction behavior of CCB was introduced into the blast furnace simulator and the effect of charging CCB to blast furnace and accompanying temperature lowering were numerically examined. The calculation results showed the increase in productivity and decrease in reducing agent rate with CCB charging while reduction of iron-bearing materials was retarded due to temperature decrease in stack region. Thermal analysis revealed that this improvement of heat efficiency is caused by the decrease in heat requirements for solution loss, sinter reduction and silicon transfer reactions, heat outflow by top gas and wall heat transfer.

AB Multi-scale structural assessment of biological soft tissue is challenging but essential to gain insight into structure-function relationships of tissue/organ. Using the human placenta as an example, this study brings together sophisticated sample preparation protocols, advanced imaging and robust, validated machine-learning segmentation techniques to provide the first massively multi-scale and multi-domain information that enables detailed morphological and functional analyses of both maternal and fetal placental domains. Finally, we quantify the scale-dependent error in morphological metrics of heterogeneous placental tissue, estimating the minimal tissue scale needed in extracting meaningful biological data. The developed protocol is beneficial for high-throughput investigation of structure-function relationships in both normal and diseased placentas, allowing us to optimize therapeutic approaches for pathological pregnancies. In addition, the methodology presented is applicable in the characterization of tissue architecture and physiological behaviours of other complex organs with similarity to the placenta, where an exchange barrier possesses circulating vascular and avascular fluid spaces.

DE Opinion dynamics; Complex network; Authoritarian society
ID OPINION
AB We investigate the formation of opinion against authority in an authoritarian society composed of agents with different levels of authority. We explore a "dissenting" opinion, held by lower-ranking, obedient, or less authoritative people, spreading in an environment of an "affirmative" opinion held by authoritative leaders. A real-world example would be a corrupt society where people revolt against such leaders, but it can be applied to more general situations. In our model, agents can change their opinion depending on their authority relative to their neighbors and their own confidence level. In addition, with a certain probability, agents can override the affirmative opinion to take the dissenting opinion of a neighbor. Based on analytic derivation and numerical simulations, we observe that both the network structure and heterogeneity in authority, and their correlation, significantly affect the possibility of the dissenting opinion to spread through the population. In particular, the dissenting opinion is suppressed when the authority distribution is very heterogeneous and there exists a positive correlation between the authority and the number of neighbors of people (degree). Except for such an extreme case, though, spreading of the dissenting opinion takes place when people have the tendency to override the authority to hold the dissenting opinion, but the dissenting opinion can take a long time to spread to the entire society, depending on the model parameters. We argue that the internal social structure of agents sets the scale of the time to reach consensus, based on the analysis of the underlying structural properties of opinion spreading.

AB The prevalence of adolescent overweight and obesity (hereafter, simply "overweight") in the US has increased over the past several decades. Individually-targeted prevention and treatment strategies targeting individuals have been disappointing, leading some to propose leveraging social networks to improve interventions. We hypothesized that social network dynamics (social marginalization; homophily on body mass index, BMI) and the strength of peer influence would increase or decrease the proportion of network member (agents) becoming overweight over a simulated year, and that peer influence would operate differently in social networks with greater overweight. We built an agent-based model (ABM) using results from R-SIENA. ABMs allow for the exploration of potential interventions using simulated agents. Initial model specifications were drawn from Wave 1 of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). We focused on a single saturation school with complete network and BMI data over two waves (n = 624). The model was validated against empirical observations at Wave 2. We focused on overall overweight prevalence after a simulated year. Five experiments were conducted: (1) changing attractiveness of high-BMI agents; (2) changing homophily on BMI; (3) changing the strength of peer influence; (4) shifting the overall BMI distribution; and (5) targeting dietary interventions to highly connected individuals. Increasing peer influence showed a dramatic decrease in the prevalence of overweight; making peer influence negative (i.e., doing the opposite of friends) increased overweight. However, the effect of peer influence varied based on the underlying distribution of BMI; when BMI was increased overall, stronger peer influence increased proportion of overweight. Other interventions, including targeted dieting, had little impact. Peer influence may be a viable target in overweight interventions, but the distribution of body size in the population needs to be taken into account. In low-obesity populations, strengthening peer influence may be a useful strategy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we consider the problem of social learning in a network of agents where the agents make decisions sequentially by choosing one of two hypotheses on the state of nature. Each agent observes a signal generated according to one of the hypotheses and knows the decisions of all the previous agents in the network. The network contains two types of agents: rational and irrational. A rational agent makes a decision by not only using its private observation but also the decisions of each of the agents which already made decisions. To that end, the agent employs Bayesian theory. An irrational agent makes a decision by ignoring the available information and by randomly choosing the hypothesis. We analyze the asymptotic performance of a system with rational and irrational agents where we study rational agents that use either a deterministic or random decision making policies. We propose a specific random decision making policy that is based on the social belief and the private signals of the agents. We prove that under mild conditions the expected social belief in the true state of nature tends to one if the rational agents use the proposed random policy. In a network with rational agents that use deterministic policy, the conditions for convergence are stricter. We provide simulation results on the studied systems and compare their performance.

AB Anthropomorphic virtual agents can serve as powerful technological mediators to impact motivational outcomes such as self-efficacy and attitude change. Such anthropomorphic agents can be designed as simulated social models in the Bandurian sense, providing social influence as virtual 'role models'. Of particular value is the capacity for designing such agents as optimized social models for a target audience and context. Importantly, the visual presence and appearance of such agents can have a major impact on motivation and affect regardless of the underlying technical sophistication. Empirical results of different instantiations of agent presence and appearance are reviewed for both autonomous virtual agents and avatars that represent a user.

AB To date, projections of human migration induced by sea-level change (SLC) largely suggest large-scale displacement away from vulnerable coastlines. However, results from our model of Bangladesh suggest counterintuitively that people will continue to migrate toward the vulnerable coastline irrespective of the flooding amplified by future SLC under all emissions scenarios until the end of this century. We developed an empirically calibrated agent-based model of household migration decision-making that captures the multi-faceted push, pull and mooring influences on migration at a household scale. We then exposed similar to 4800 000 simulated migrants to 871 scenarios of projected 21st-century coastal flooding under future emissions pathways. Our model does not predict flooding impacts great enough to drive populations away from coastlines in any of the scenarios. One reason is that while flooding does accelerate a transition from agricultural to non-agricultural income opportunities, livelihood alternatives are most abundant in coastal cities. At the same time, some coastal populations are unable to migrate, as flood losses accumulate and reduce the set of livelihood alternatives (so-called 'trapped' populations). However, even when we increased access to credit, a commonly-proposed policy lever for incentivizing migration in the face of climate risk, we found that the number of immobile agents actually rose. These findings imply that instead of a straightforward relationship between displacement and migration, projections need to consider the multiple constraints on, and preferences for, mobility. Our model demonstrates that decision-makers seeking to affect migration outcomes around SLC would do well to consider individual-level adaptive behaviors and motivations that evolve through time, as well as the potential for unintended behavioral responses.

AB This paper addresses the formation control problem for a group of mechanical systems with nonlinear uncertain dynamics under the virtual leader-following framework. New cooperative deterministic learning-based adaptive formation control algorithms are proposed. Specifically, the virtual leader dynamics is constructed as a linear system subject to unknown bounded inputs, so as to produce more diverse reference signals for formation tracking control. A cooperative discontinuous nonlinear estimation protocol is first proposed to estimate the leader's state information. Based on this, a cooperative deterministic learning formation control protocol is developed using artificial neural networks, such that formation tracking control and locally-accurate nonlinear identification with learning knowledge consensus can be achieved simultaneously. Finally, by utilizing the learned knowledge represented by constant neural networks, an experience-based distributed control protocol is further proposed to enable position-swappable formation control. Numerical simulations using a group of autonomous underwater vehicles have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed results.

AB Formal institutions impact on the dynamics of land use change through their objectives, actions and decision-making processes in response to socio-economic or environmental changes such as climate change. The effects and interplay of these actions are not fully understood, and hence, institutional processes are rarely integrated in modelling analyses of land use change. The complex effects of institutional interactions within land systems can be better understood through modelling approaches that address the heterogeneity of the institutional actors involved and how their decisions affect temporal and spatial dynamics. In this paper, we present an agent-based model of autonomous land managers interacting with institutional agents at two spatial scales. We explore different parameters of institutional intervention (subsidy rate, triggers for action, delay in monitoring, scale-based precedence) under socio-economic drivers and analyse key metrics such as the maximum over- and undersupply of ecosystem services, connectivity of land uses, and degree of change in land use patterns. Levels of subsidy and action triggers have the greatest impact on the magnitude of land use change and the maximum oversupply of ecosystem services. In terms of achieving institutional objectives, subsidy rate is the most important single parameter in the model. Furthermore, we find non-linearity with variations in parameters that have important implications for current land use change modelling and requirements for empirical studies of land use planning institutions. Finally, the effects of high-end climate change may require entirely novel institutional behaviours.

A human-subject experiment was conducted to classify agent types and determine their effects on contribution levels. Data from the experiment was used to build and calibrate an agent-based simulation model. The simulations display how different compositions of agent preference types affect the contribution levels. Findings indicate that the heterogeneity of cooperative preferences is an important determinant of a population's contribution pattern.

AB What is the emergent long-run equilibrium of a society, where many interacting agents bet on the optimal energy to put in place in order to climb on the Bandwagon? In this paper, we study the collective behavior of a large population of agents being either Left or Right: The core idea is that agents benefit from being with the winner party, but, on the other hand, they suffer a cost in changing their status quo. At the microscopic level, the model is formulated as a stochastic, symmetric dynamic game with N players. In the macroscopic limit as N ->+infinity\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$N \rightarrow +\,\infty $$\end{document}, the model can be rephrased as a mean field game, whose equilibria describe the "rational" collective behavior of the society. It is of particular interest to detect the emerging long time attractors, e.g., consensus or oscillating behavior. Significantly, we discover that bandwagoning can be persistent at the macrolevel: We provide evidence, also on the basis of numerical simulations, of endogenously generated periodicity.

AB In a dynamic system, such as social and economic systems, complex interactions emerge among its members. In that case, their behaviors become adaptive according to changing environment. In this paper, we use the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD) game, which is simple yet capable of dealing with complex problems, to model the dynamic system, and propose strategic coalition to obtain superior adaptive agents and simulate its emergence in a co-evolutionary learning environment. Also, we introduce the concept of confidence for agents in a coalition and show how such confidence helps improving the generalization ability of the evolved agents using strategic coalition. Experimental results show that co-evolutionary learning with coalition and confidence can produce better performing agents that generalize well against unseen agents. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB We propose an agent-based model for the simulation of the autoimmune response in T1D. The model incorporates cell behavior from various rules derived from the current literature and is implemented on a high-performance computing system, which enables the simulation of a significant portion of the islets in the mouse pancreas. Simulation results indicate that the model is able to capture the trends that emerge during the progression of the autoimmunity. The multi-scale nature of the model enables definition of rules or equations that govern cellular or sub-cellular level phenomena and observation of the outcomes at the tissue scale. It is expected that such a model would facilitate in vivo clinical studies through rapid testing of hypotheses and planning of future experiments by providing insight into disease progression at different scales, some of which may not be obtained easily in clinical studies. Furthermore, the modular structure of the model simplifies tasks such as the addition of new cell types, and the definition or modification of different behaviors of the environment and the cells with ease.

AB Punishment plays a crucial role in favoring and maintaining social order. Recent studies emphasize the effect of the norm-signaling function of punishment. However, very little attention has been paid so far to the potential of group punishment. We claim that when inflicted by an entire group, the recipient of punishment views it as expressing norms. The experiments performed in this work provide evidence that humans are motivated not only by material incentives that punishment imposes but also by normative information that it conveys. The same material incentive has a different effect on the individuals' future compliance depending on the way it is implemented, having a stronger effect when it also conveys normative information. We put forward the hypothesis that by inflicting equal material incentives, group punishment is more effective in enhancing compliance than uncoordinated punishment, because it takes advantage of the norm-signaling function of punishment. In support of our hypothesis, we present cross-methodological data, that is, data obtained through agent-based simulation and laboratory experiments with human subjects. The combination of these two methods allows us to provide an explanation for the proximate mechanisms generating the cooperative behavior observed in the laboratory experiment.

AB The mining industry has difficulties predicting changes in the level of community acceptance of its projects over time. These changes are due to changes in the society and individual perceptions around these mines as a result of the mines' environmental and social impacts. Agent-based modeling can be used to facilitate better understanding of how community acceptance changes with changing mine environmental impacts. This work investigates the sensitivity of an agent-based model (ABM) for predicting changes in community acceptance of a mining project due to information diffusion to key input parameters. Specifically, this study investigates the responsiveness of the ABM to average degree (total number of friends) of the social network, close neighbour ratio (a measure of homophily in the social network) and number of early adopters ("innovators"). A two-level full factorial experiment was used to investigate the sensitivity of the model to these parameters. The primary (main), secondary and tertiary effects of each parameter were estimated to assess the model's sensitivity. The results show that the model is more responsive to close neighbour ratio and number of early adopters than average degree. Consequently, uncertainty surrounding the inferences drawn from simulation experiments using the agent-based model will be minimized by obtaining more reliable estimates of close neighbour ratio and number of early adopters. While it is possible to reliably estimate the level of early adopters from the literature, the degree of homophily (close neighbour ratio) has to be estimated from surveys that can be expensive and unreliable. Further, work is required to find economic ways to document relevant degrees of homophily in social networks in mining communities.

AB A number of marketing phenomena are too complex for conventional analytical or empirical approaches. This makes marketing a costly process of trial and error: proposing, imagining, trying in the real world, and seeing results. Alternatively, Agent-based Social Simulation (ABSS) is becoming the most popular approach to model and study these phenomena. This research paradigm allows modeling a virtual market to: design, understand, and evaluate marketing hypotheses before taking them to the real world. However, there are shortcomings in the specialized literature such as the lack of methods, data, and implemented tools to deploy a realistic virtual market with ABSS. To advance the state of the art in this complex and interesting problem, this paper is a seven-fold contribution based on a (1) method to design and validate viral marketing strategies in Twitter by ABSS. The method is illustrated with the widely studied problem of rumor diffusion in social networks. After (2) an extensive review of the related works for this problem, (3) an innovative spread model is proposed which rests on the exploratory data analysis of two different rumor datasets in Twitter. Besides, (4) new strategies are proposed to control malicious gossips. (5) The experimental results validate the realism of this new propagation model with the datasets and (6) the strategies performance is evaluated over this model. (7) Finally, the article is complemented by a free and open-source simulator. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Modeling Public Opinion Polarization in Group Behavior by Integrating

DT Article
ID EPIDEMIC MODEL
AB Currently, China is in the period of social transformation. Such transformation continuously results in high group polarization behaviors, which attracts many attentions. In order to explore the evolutionary mechanism and formation process of group polarization behavior, this paper proposes a group polarization model which is integrated into the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible (SIRS) epidemic model. In this paper, firstly, the SIRS epidemic model and the factors of relationship strength are introduced based on the J-A model (proposed by Jager and Amblard) to enhance the information transmission and interaction among individuals. In addition, the BA network (proposed by Barabasi and Albert) model is used as the agent adjacency model due to its closeness to the real social network structure. After that, the Monte Carlo method is applied to conduct experimental simulation. Subsequently, this paper analyzes the simulation results in threefold: (1) comparison of polarization processes with and without integration of the SIRS epidemic model; (2) adjusting the immune recovery parameter gamma and the relationship strengthzto explore the role of these two parameters in the polarization process; and (3) comparing the polarization effects of different network structures. Through the experiments, we find that BA network is more polarized than small-world network in the same scale. Finally, corresponding measures are proposed to prevent and mitigate the occurrence of group polarization.

AB Weatherizing residential buildings to make them more energy efficient offers great potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, conserving resources, and improving occupant comfort and well-being in the face of climate change. However, weatherization adoption rates remain low. Previous research suggests that social norms and energy-related interactions within a community have greater influence on households' weatherization adoption decisions than financial incentives. Therefore, an increased understanding of how social factors can be leveraged to encourage more households to weatherize is needed. This paper describes a hybrid simulation model on households' weatherization adoption decisions in an urban community. The simulation model integrates a building energy simulation model with an agent-based model that is embedded in a social network to represent the interactions, adaptations, and decision making of individual households over time. The model is demonstrated for several experimental scenarios for a residential block in the City of Des Moines, Iowa. Results indicate that social connectedness, community leaders, and delivery mechanisms for weatherization assistance all have a significant impact on household weatherization adoption. These results provide insight into the potential of policy interventions to increase weatherization adoption.

AB Understanding the mechanism underlying the mobile telecommunications technologies (MTTs) diffusion in a country is crucial for telecom planners to know how to accelerate their diffusion by designing appropriate scenarios. Considering the technology diffusion as a bottom-up process, this study is aimed at exploring this mechanism, drawing on insights from diffusion of innovation theory and social network theory. Accordingly, an agent-based model is proposed to investigate how MTTs are diffused in Iran over time. The results of this study show, (1) social network of Iranian society seems more similar to a Watts-Strogatz small-world network than a Barabasi-Albert preferential attachment network, where the clustering coefficient is high and average path length is low, (2) compared to the compatibility parameter, the advertisement parameter not only is less influential on diffusion of a targeted MTT (i.e., 4G) but also is not necessary for it, and (3) scenarios having the least number of steps and turning points are more appropriate for continuous diffusion of 4G. The proposed study is empirically validated against real-world data ranging from 7/1/2017 to 12/31/2017. We believe it provides telecom planners insights regarding MTTs diffusion mechanism in a social complex structure and the how of scenario designing for increasing their diffusion.

AB We have introduced recently a model for the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, in which the social behavior is incorporated as a key factor for the further propagation of the infection. The system may be regarded as a society of agents where in principle anyone can sexually interact with any other one in the population. The social behavior is taking into account by means of two parameters: the fraction of singles rho(s) and the promiscuity p. The promiscuity parameter defines the per individual daily probability of going out to look for a sexual partner, abandoning its eventual mate. In this contribution we show that the interaction between this two parameters give rise to a non-trivial epidemic threshold condition, when going from the homogeneous case (rho(s) = 1) to heterogeneous cases (rho(s) < 1). These results can have profound implication in the interpretation of real epidemic data. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Although trust can have a positively mediating effect on information technology adoption and usage, the concept has not been extensively investigated in the home automation field. Therefore, this work is aimed at exploring the role of agent location and the gender of the agent's voice on users' perception of trust toward automation through two experimental studies (N = 8 and N = 20) and a web-based smart lock simulation. Explicit trust behavior was captured using directly observable behaviors and decisions, while implicit trust behavior was captured using detailed click-level user behaviors with the smart lock simulation as a proxy for reaction time. The results show that users displayed more explicit trusting behavior toward the system when it displayed design characteristics that were stereotype congruent (female-home and male-office) compared to stereotype incongruent systems (male-home and female-office). These results show that users carry over the social expectations and roles encountered in human-to-human relationships to interactions with simulated automated agents. These findings empirically demonstrate the influence of design characteristics on the formation of trust relationships between users and automated devices and provide a foundation for future research geared at critically examining our evolving relationship with technology.

AB This paper considers fully distributed adaptive protocol design for cooperative tracking problem based only on pure relative output information. To tackle leader's trajectory in the presence of unknown control input, most of the existing observer-based protocols are designed based on absolute output information as well as the relative observer information among neighboring agents, which would suffer from potential network attack. To conquer such limitation, the definition of attack-free protocol is proposed, where no communication information exchange is allowed among neighboring agents, but only relative output measurement can be available. In this setting, the protocol is born to be free from network attack. By taking leader's control input as external disturbance for each agent, some new kinds of full-order and reduced-order disturbance separation observers are introduced to achieve observation of consensus error. Based on such observer design methods, fully distributed adaptive protocols are successfully proposed to realize distributed tracking without using any absolute output information nor the spectrum information of the graph. Another favorable property of the protocols lies in the communication burden reduction, since to obtain the attack-free feature, each agent does not communicate its designed observer with its neighbors. The effectiveness of the proposed protocols are verified by numerical simulations on a group of transport aircrafts with short-period dynamics. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Although the importance of social norms in affecting health behaviors is widely recognized, the current understanding of the social norm effects on obesity is limited due to data and methodology limitations. This study aims to use nontraditional innovative systems methods to examine: a) the effects of social norms on school children's BMI growth and fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption, and b) the effects of misperceptions of social norms on US children's BMI growth.
   Methods: We built an agent-based model (ABM) in a utility maximization framework and parameterized the model based on empirical longitudinal data collected in a US nationally representative study, the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study -Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K), to test potential mechanisms of social norm affecting children's BMI growth and FV consumption.
   Results: Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for BMI were 0.064-0.065, suggesting that children's BMI were similar within each school. The correlation between observed and ABM-predicted BMI was 0.87, indicating the validity of our ABM. Our simulations suggested the follow-the-average social norm acts as an endogenous stabilizer, which automatically adjusts positive and negative deviance of an individual's BMI from the group mean of a social network. One unit of BMI below the social average may lead to 0.025 unit increase in BMI per year for each child; asymmetrically, one unit of BMI above the social average, may only cause 0.015 unit of BMI reduction. Gender difference was apparent. Social norms have less impact on weight reduction among girls, and a greater impact promoting weight increase among boys. Our simulation also showed misperception of the social norm would push up the mean BMI and cause the distribution to be more skewed to the left. Our simulation results did not provide strong support for the role of social norms on FV consumption.
   Conclusions: Social norm influences US children's BMI growth. High obesity prevalence will lead to a continuous increase in children's BMI due to increased socially acceptable mean BMI. Interventions promoting healthy body image and desirable socially acceptable BMI should be implemented to control childhood obesity epidemic.

AB We built an agent-based simulation, incorporating geographic and demographic data from nineteenth-century France, to study the role of social interactions in fertility decisions. The simulation made experimentation possible in a context where other empirical strategies were precluded by a lack of data. We evaluated how different decision rules, with and without interdependent decision-making, caused variations in population growth and fertility levels. The analyses show that incorporating social influence into the model allows empirically observed behaviour to be mimicked, especially at a national level. These findings shed light on individual-level mechanisms through which the French demographic transition may have developed.

AB This article addresses knowledge transfer dynamics in agent-based computational social science. The goal of the text is twofold. First, it describes the tensions arising from the convergence of different disciplinary traditions in the emergence of this new area of study and, second, it shows how these tensions are dealt with through the articulation of distinctive practices of knowledge production and transmission. To achieve this goal, three major instances of knowledge transfer dynamics in agent-based computational social science are analysed. The first instance is the emergence of the research field. Relations of knowledge transfer and cross-fertilisation between agent-based computational social science and wider and more established disciplinary areas: complexity science, computational science and social science, are discussed. The second instance is the approach to scientific modelling in the field. It is shown how the practice of agent-based modelling is affected by the conflicting coexistence of shared methodological commitments transferred from both empirical and formal disciplines. Lastly, the third instance pertains internal practices of knowledge production and transmission. Through the discussion of these practices, the tensions arising from converging dissimilar disciplinary traditions in agent-based computational social science are highlighted. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We developed a new optimization algorithm for multiagent coordination based on indirect and unsupervised communication. The mobile agents team task is simply searching and collecting "food items". The global coherent behavior is emergent, meaning that despite the fact that agents have no global map of the environment and do not directly communicate with each other they coordinate their behavior to achieve a global "goal". The coordinated response of the agents is the result of indirect communication via local changes in the environment. Each agent records the encountered objects in a memory register and by appropriate weighting of local perception the agent tries to estimate the global spatial distributions of the objects in the environment. The range of spatial and temporal indirect coupling among the agents is controlled via a "memory radius". We developed an optimized an algorithm that adapts the "memory radius" according to environment changes to minimize the computational time required to achieve the "goal" (piling the objects of the same kind together). Our optimization procedure is based on the correlation feature of the emergent pattern. The maximum speed of feature decreases leads to an optimized dependence of the "memory radius" on simulation time step. We derived also an analytic relationship between the "memory radius" and the time step based on the intermediate steady-state assumption. Numerical simulations confirmed that our analytic relationship coincides with the numerical optimization criterion based on the correlation feature.

AB Computer simulations are increasingly used to monitor and predict behavior at large crowd events, such as mass gatherings, festivals and evacuations. We critically examine the crowd modeling literature and call for future simulations of crowd behavior to be based more closely on findings from current social psychological research. A systematic review was conducted on the crowd modeling literature (N = 140 articles) to identify the assumptions about crowd behavior that modelers use in their simulations. Articles were coded according to the way in which crowd structure was modeled. It was found that 2 broad types are used: mass approaches and small group approaches. However, neither the mass nor the small group approaches can accurately simulate the large collective behavior that has been found in extensive empirical research on crowd events. We argue that to model crowd behavior realistically, simulations must use methods which allow crowd members to identify with each other, as suggested by self-categorization theory.

AB Extortion racketeering is an industry not only practiced by mafia, but also in groups such as hells angels. It occurs in a complex setting of criminals, victims, police and society, and its framework is set up by legal norms as well as informal norms of the actor groups involved. The paper presents two agent-based simulation models which differ with respect to the decision making mode, which is either stochastical with fixed probabilities or deliberative where decisions depend on utility considerations and norms learned during the process. The central research questions of the paper - beside the question how extortion racket system can be appropriately modeled - concern the divergence of the results of the two model versions, the comparison of the input parameter combinations, the motivations of input parameters and the validation of the results by comparing them to available empirical data.

AB We present an integrated modeling framework for simulating land-use decision making under the influence of payments for ecosystem services. The model combines agent-based modeling (ABM) with Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) and opinion dynamics models (ODM). The model endows agents with the ability to make land-use decisions at the household and plot levels. The decision-making process is captured with the BBNs that were constructed and calibrated with both qualitative and quantitative information, i.e., knowledge gained from group discussions with stakeholders and empirical survey data. To represent interpersonal interactions within social networks, the decision process is further modulated by the opinion dynamics model. The goals of the model are to improve the ability of ABM to emulate land-use decision making and thus provide a better understanding of the potential impacts of payments for ecosystem services on land use and household livelihoods. Our approach provides three important innovations. First, decision making is represented in a causal directed graph. Second, the model provides a natural framework for combining knowledge from experts and stakeholders with quantitative data. Third, the modular architecture and the software implementation can be customized with modest efforts. The model is therefore a flexible, general platform that can be tailored to other studies by mounting the appropriate case-specific "brain" into the agents. The model was calibrated for the Sloping Land Conversion Program (SLCP) in Yunnan, China using data from participatory mapping, focus group interviews, and a survey of 509 farm households in 17 villages.

AB Understanding the adaptive responses of individual bacterial strains is crucial for microbiome engineering approaches that introduce new functionalities into complex microbiomes, such as xenobiotic compound metabolism for soil bioremediation. Adaptation requires metabolic reprogramming of the cell, which can be captured by multi-omics, but this data remains formidably challenging to interpret and predict. Here we present a new approach that combines genome-scale metabolic modeling with transcriptomics and exometabolomics, both of which are common tools for studying dynamic population behavior. As a realistic demonstration, we developed a genome-scale model of Pseudomonas veronii 1YdBTEX2, a candidate bioaugmentation agent for accelerated metabolism of mono-aromatic compounds in soil microbiomes, while simultaneously collecting experimental data of P. veronii metabolism during growth phase transitions. Predictions of the P. veronii growth rates and specific metabolic processes from the integrated model closely matched experimental observations. We conclude that integrative and network-based analysis can help build predictive models that accurately capture bacterial adaptation responses. Further development and testing of such models may considerably improve the successful establishment of bacterial inoculants in more complex systems.

AB A simulation is presented of a grid of connected societies of reproducing agents. These agents are capable of horizontal and vertical transmission of non-genetic cultural traits (memes). This simulation exhibits the theoretically predicted effect that horizontally transmitted memes are less likely, overall, to be encountered in geographical isolation than strictly vertically transmitted ones. Furthermore, when horizontal memes are under cultural selection, and thus behave 'contagiously', their likelihood of geographical isolation is virtually eliminated. By contrast, natural selection has far weaker effects than cultural selection in reducing geographical isolation. Thus it should be possible to identify contagious memes by an examination of their geographical distribution. The degree of geographical isolation of 17 categories of postulated cultural traits in an ethnographic data set of 863 societies is then examined, and compared with the simulations, using z-tests. Using this method, the empirical data can be sorted into four broad categories, each with a different spectrum of probabilities of mode of transmission and contagion.

AB This paper investigates the attitude coordinated tracking control for a group of rigid spacecraft under directed communication topology, in which inertia uncertainties, external disturbances, input saturation and constant time-delays between the formation members are handled. Initially, the nominal system with communication delays is studied. A delay-dependent controller is proposed by using Lyapunov-Krasovskii function and sufficient condition for system stability is derived. Then, an integral sliding manifold is designed and adaptive control approach is employed to deal with the total perturbation. Meanwhile, the boundary layer method is introduced to alleviate the unexpected chattering as system trajectories cross the switching surface. Finally, numerical simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control strategy.

AB Many models of social network formation implicitly assume that network properties are static in steady-state. In contrast, actual social networks are highly dynamic: allegiances and collaborations expire and may or may not be renewed at a later date. Moreover, empirical studies show that human social networks are dynamic at the individual level but static at the global level: individuals' degree rankings change considerably over time, whereas network-level metrics such as network diameter and clustering coefficient are relatively stable. There have been some attempts to explain these properties of empirical social networks using agent-based models in which agents play social dilemma games with their immediate neighbours, but can also manipulate their network connections to strategic advantage. However, such models cannot straightforwardly account for reciprocal behaviour based on reputation scores ("indirect reciprocity"), which is known to play an important role in many economic interactions. In order to account for indirect reciprocity, we model the network in a bottom-up fashion: the network emerges from the low-level interactions between agents. By so doing we are able to simultaneously account for the effect of both direct reciprocity (e.g. "tit-for-tat") as well as indirect reciprocity (helping strangers in order to increase one's reputation). This leads to a strategic equilibrium in the frequencies with which strategies are adopted in the population as a whole, but intermittent cycling over different strategies at the level of individual agents, which in turn gives rise to social networks which are dynamic at the individual level but stable at the network level.

AB There is a growing belief that the agents' cognitive structures play a central role on the enhancement of predicative capacities of decision-making strategies. This paper analyses and simulates the construction of cognitive social structures in the process of decision making with multiple actors. In this process it is argued that the agent's rational choices may be assessed by its motivations, according to different patterns of social interactions. We first construct an abstract model of social dependence between agents, and define a set of social structures that are easily identifiable according to potential interactions. We then carry out a set of experiments at micro-social levels of analysis, where the agents' cognitive structures are explicitly represented. These experiments indicate that different social dependence structures imply distinct structural patterns of negotiation proposals, which appear to have diverse patterns of complexity in the search space. It is subsequently shown that this observation emerges as an issue of ambiguity in the regulation of different decision-making criteria, relative to motivation-oriented and utility-oriented choices. In the scope of this ambiguity, we finally make some conjectures relative to further analytical and empirical analysis around the relation between patterns of complexity of social structures and decision-making.

AB This paper estimates changes in pensions and long-term financial sustainability of the Czech pension system in the light of population ageing, market imperfections or a potential economic downturn, and assesses feasibility of various parametric and structural reforms. To do so, it develops a bespoke OLG model with heterogeneous agents, bequests, productivity shocks, market imperfections, and realistic representation of three distinct types of pension systems calibrated using real-world data. Numerical results are obtained through computer simulations. The estimates show that a well-designed multi-pillar pension scheme provides good results in a number of performance indicators without leading to excessive costs of transition, whereas maintaining the current PAY-GO scheme would lead to a gradual decrease in real pensions, lower pension-to-wage ratios, higher budget deficits, or any combination thereof, unless the statutory retirement age increases beyond 67 years by 2050.

AB We analyze the effect of spatial heterogeneity in the initial spin distribution on spin dynamics in a three-state square lattice divided into spatial cells (districts). In the spirit of the statistical mechanics of social impact, we introduce a dominant influence rule (DIR), according to which, in a single update step, a chosen node adopts the state determined by the influence of its discussion group formed by the node itself and its neighbors within one or more coordination spheres. In contrast to models based on some form of majority rule (MR), a system governed by the DIR is easily trapped in a stable nonconsensus state, if all nodes of the discussion group have the same weight of influence. To ensure that a consensus in the DIR system is necessarily reached, we need to put a stochastic process in the update rule. Further, the stochastic DIR model is used as a starting point for understanding the effect of spatial heterogeneity of active agent (non-zero spin) distribution on the exit probabilities. Initially, the positive and negative spins (active agents) are assigned to some nodes with non-uniform spatial distributions; while the rest of the nodes remain in the state with spin zero (uncommitted voters). By varying the relative means and skewness of the initial spin distributions, we observe critical behaviors of exit probabilities in finite size systems. The critical exponents are obtained by Monte Carlo simulations. The results of numerical simulations are discussed in the context of social dynamics. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Social networks analysis and mining gets ever-increasing importance in various disciplines. In this context finding the most influential nodes with the highest social power is important in many applications including spreading of innovation, opinion formation, immunization, information propagation and recommendation. In this manuscript, we propose a mathematical framework in order to effectively estimate the social power (influence) of nodes from time series of their interactions. We assume that there is a connection network on which the nodes interact and exchange their opinions. The time series of the opinion values (with hidden social power values) are taken as input to the proposed formalism and an optimization approach results the estimated for the social power values. We propose an estimation framework based on Maximum-a-Posteriori method that can be converted to a convex optimization problem using Jensen inequality. We apply the proposed method on a number of model networks and show that it correctly estimates the true values of the social power. The proposed method is not sensitive to the specific form of social power used to produce the time series of the opinion values. We also consider an application of finding influential nodes in opinion formation through informed agents. In this application, the problem is to find a number of influential nodes to which the informed agents should be connected to maximize their influence. Our numerical simulations show that the proposed method outperforms classical heuristic methods including connecting the informed agents to nodes with the highest degree, betweenness, closeness, PageRank centralities or based on a state-of-the-art opinion-based model.

AB With the prevalence of social media and location-aware mobile devices, travelers may make travel decisions not only by referring to their own experiences and conventional travel information, but also information shared on their social media. This study investigates the influence of this novel information on commuters' day-to-day departure time choices. We introduce a general framework for departure time choice with information sharing via social networks, which can be applied to any social network structure and is flexible for future extensions. The key in the framework, the learning process from friends' information in decision-making, is modeled based on the Bayesian learning theory. The properties of this learning model and the dynamics of the day-to-day departure time choice are analyzed. We further propose an agent-based approach to simulate travelers' choices. The parameters in the learning model are estimated based on an experimental data set. The agent-based approach is applied to validate the model and examine the effect of different social network structures, in terms of both travel choices and transportation system performance.

AB CTX-M-15 are the most prevalent types of beta-lactamases that hydrolyze almost all antibiotics of beta-lactam group lead to multiple-antibiotic resistance in bacteria. Three beta-lactam inhibitors are available for use in combination with different antibiotics of cephalosporine group against the CTX-M-15-producing strains. Therefore, strategies to identify novel anti beta-lactamase agents with specific mechanisms of action are the need of an hour. In this study, we screened three novel non-beta-lactam inhibitors against CTX-M-15 by multi-step virtual screening approach. The potential for virtually screened drugs was estimated through in vitro cell assays. Hence, we proposed a study to understand the binding mode of CTX-M-15 with inhibitors using bioinformatics and experimental approach. We calculated the dissociation constants (K-d), association constant (K-a), stoichiometry (n) and binding energies (Delta G) of compounds with the respective targets. Molecular dynamic simulation carried out for 25ns, revealed that these complexes were found stable throughout the simulation with relative RMSD in acceptable range. Moreover, microbiological and kinetic studies further confirmed high efficacies of these inhibitors by reducing the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and catalysis of antibiotics by -lactamases in the presence of inhibitors. Therefore, we conclude that these potential inhibitors may be used as a lead molecule for future drug candidates against beta-lactamases-producing bacteria.

AB In recent decades, many studies have shown that schizophrenia is associated with severe social cognitive impairments affecting key components, such as the recognition of emotions, theory of mind, attributional style, and metacognition. Most studies investigated each construct separately, precluding analysis of the interactive and immersive nature of real-life situation. Specialized batteries of tests are under investigation to assess social cognition, which is thought now as a link between neurocognitive disorders and impaired functioning. However, this link accounts for a limited part of the variance of real-life functioning. To fill this gap, advances in virtual reality and affective computing have made it possible to carry out experimental investigations of naturalistic social cognition, in controlled conditions, with good reproducibility. This approach is illustrated with the description of a new paradigm based on an original virtual card game in which subjects interpret emotional displays from a female virtual agent, and decipher her helping intentions. Independent variables concerning emotional expression in terms of valence and intensity were manipulated. We show how several useful dependant variables, ranging from classic experimental psychology data to metacognition or subjective experiences records, may be extracted from a single experiment. Methodological issues about the immersion into a simulated intersubjective situation are considered.The example of this new flexible experimental setting, with regards to the many constructs recognized in social neurosciences, constitutes a rationale for focusing on this potential intermediate link between standardized tests and real-life functioning, and also for using it as an innovative media for cognitive remediation.

AB This paper presents a novel approach for individual agent's motion simulation in real-time virtual environments. In our model, we focus on addressing two problems: 1) the control model for local motions. We propose to represent a combination of psychological and geometrical rules with a social and physical forces model so that it can avoid individual agent's local collision. 2) Global path planning algorithm with moving obstacle. We propose a more efficient algorithm by extending the indicative route method. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can be tuned to simulate different types of crowd behaviors under a variety of conditions, and can naturally exhibit emergent phenomena that have been observed in real crowds.

AB Agent-based crowd models describe pedestrians as autonomous interacting agents. Current models take into account the physical contact forces occurring in a crowd, but the description of many behavioural actions is still a challenge. This paper presents a model for agents' behaviour in counterflow situations, where they try to avoid collisions with oncoming agents. In the model, the agents observe the walking directions of the agents in front of them and choose their own actions accordingly. We implement the model to the widely used social force model, which describes the motion of each agent in a Newtonian manner. Nevertheless, the basic idea of the counterflow model can be used with various modelling platforms. We study the effects of the model's parameters with Monte Carlo simulations and justify our selection of their values. Simulation results are compared with previously published experimental data and the results match well. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper introduces the implementation of a computational agent-based financial market model in which the system is described on both microscopic and macroscopic levels. This artificial financial market model is used to study the system response when a shock occurs. Indeed, when a market experiences perturbations, financial systems behavior can exhibit two different properties: resilience and robustness. Through simulations and different scenarios of market shocks, these system properties are studied. The results notably show that the emergence of collective herding behavior when market shock occurs leads to a temporary disruption of the system self-organization. Numerical simulations highlight that the market can absorb strong mono-shocks but can also be led to rupture by low but repeated perturbations.

AB Applies a computer model GAIA (Groups of Adaptive Inferencing Agents) to simulate the lifecycle of artificial groups directed by agendas which specify varying strategies for collective problem solving. Within GAIA, groups of artificial agents dynamically learn and interact by proposing, combining and testing inductive hypotheses in the form of genetic building blocks. Agents share and combine building block solutions to evolve decision trees to respond to environmental inputs. Effects of agendas which emphasize stages of conservative and liberal problem solving strategies over a group's lifecycle were simulated. Conservative strategies emphasize consensus and collective memories within groups. Liberal strategies emphasize challenges to collective memory and individual agent predictions. Agendas which vary from conservative to liberal resulted in the poor group solutions. Significantly better group solutions were produced by an agenda varying from liberal to conservative and back to liberal (L-C-L). The L-C-L agenda focuses on critical evaluation and rewards for individual contribution in the beginning and ending lifecycle stages and provides a middle stage of collective exploration.

AB Social simulations gain strength when agent behaviour can (1) represent human behaviour and (2) be explained in understandable terms. Agents with values and norms lead to simulation results that meet human needs for explanations, but have not been tested on their ability to reproduce human behaviour. This paper compares empirical data on human behaviour to simulated data on agents with values and norms in a psychological experiment on dividing money: the ultimatum game. We find that our agent model with values and norms produces aggregate behaviour that falls within the 95% confidence interval wherein human behaviour lies more often than other tested agent models. A main insight is that values serve as a static component in agent behaviour, whereas norms serve as a dynamic component.

AB This paper investigates an evolutionary iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD) model of multiple agents, in which agents interact in terms of the pair-wise IPD game while adapting their attitudes towards income stream risk. Specifically, agents will become more risk averse (or more risk seeking) if their game payoffs exceed (or fall below) their expectations. In particular, agents use their peers' average payoffs as expectations (social comparison) when their payoffs are lower than their peers' averages, but use their own historical payoffs as expectations (historical comparison) when their payoffs are higher than their peers' averages. Such selective attention to social comparison or historical comparison manifests a desire for continuous improvement of agents. Simulations are conducted to investigate the evolution of cooperation under the selective attention mechanism. Results indicate that agents can sustain a highly cooperative equilibrium when they consider selective attention in adjusting their risk attitudes. This holds true for both the well-mixed and the network-based games, even in the presence of uncertain game payoffs. The reason is that, selective attention can significantly induce agents to adhere to conditional cooperation as well as to identify uncertainty in payoffs, which enhances the risk-averse behavior of agents in the IPD game. As a result, high levels of cooperation can be attained.

AB Scientific studies from anthropologists, biologists, and sociologists hypothesized people who live in the geo neighborhood have more chances to contact with each other and construct the social relationships. This paper exploits a simulation-based approach to verify such hypothesis through unveiling the connection between the spatial-temporal movements of people and their social relationships. Based on the crowd simulation technique, we design an agent-based framework, social flocks, to model the geo spatial correlation of social elements. We simulate the movements of people to tackle two tasks, social network generation and network community detection. By mapping nodes in the network into agents in the simulation, we examine whether the social networks generated by our model can satisfy the network properties, such as high clustering coefficient, low average path length, and power-law degree distribution. Besides, given a social network, we simulate the social moving behaviors of agents/nodes to study the formation of communities. Experiments conducted for such two tasks verify the proposed hypotheses. Social flocks can also serve as a visualization platform for experts to explore the effects over the spatial, temporal, and social contexts. Through demonstrating how the simulation models are exploited to address social network problems, this paper encourages more studies on this direction.

AB An agent-based model is presented that mechanistically simulates social interactions across two partially coupled lattices, each containing a mixture of individualists, net-workers, and reciprocators. Numerical experiments reveal evidence for two spontaneously emergent and widely relevant complex behaviors: self-organized criticality generating fractal (1/f) dynamics, and a scale-free (power-law degree distribution) network, adding to the short list of generative mechanisms for these phenomena. The model may also suggest explanatory hypotheses for two sociological puzzles: Richardson's scaling law for war size; and an inverse relationship between actor scale and water resource conflict, potentially relevant to this century's prognosticated water wars. Adjusting a handful of model parameters yields a diverse set of fundamentally different behaviors, perhaps implying model applicability to a wide range of social systems and that comparatively simple social engineering steps could conceivably induce large social shifts.

AB Stereotypes is one of the most researched topics in social psychology. Within this context, negative self-stereotypes pose a particular challenge for theories. In the current work, we propose a model that suggests that negative self-stereotypes can theoretically be accounted for by the need to communicate in a social system made up by groups with unequal power. Because our theory is dynamic, probabilistic, and interactionist, we use a computational simulation technique to show that the proposed model is able to reproduce the phenomenon of interest, to provide novel accounts of related phenomena, and to suggest novel empirical predictions. We describe our computational model, our variables' dynamic behavior and interactions, and link our analyses to the literature on stereotypes and self-stereotypes, the stability of stereotypes (in particular, gender and racial stereotypes), the effects of power asymmetries, and the effects of intergroup contact.

AB Seasonal climate forecasts provide probabilistic information on future climate on time-scales of two to three months. Where this information is not presently used it is difficult to evaluate the impact it might have. In order to justify disseminating the information to marginal groups it is important that the potential impact of the forecast is explored so that the negative and positive effects are at least partially appreciated before use of the information is widely promoted. We use an agent-based social simulation model, based on empirical evidence from field work in Lesotho, to assess the impact of using seasonal forecasts among smallholder farmers. The impact of using the forecast depends on the agents' initial household characteristics, what options they choose in responding to the forecast and the trust they place in the forecast (which in turn depends on their ability to learn and to follow their neighbours). Interaction of climate, crop productivity and social factors determines how much household-agents benefit or lose, evaluated in terms of crop yields and likelihood of exhausting food storage. Adoption of the forecast has the potential to decrease starvation among marginal household-agents but poor forecasts may do more harm than good. This work suggests that if forecasts are not correct more than 60-70% of the time, then they are unlikely to benefit poor farmers. Poor forecasts, or forecasts that fail badly, when they do fail, lead to longer adoption timescales for forecast use. Further investigation into the impact of the forecast at the village level is encouraged before dissemination is actively pursued without appreciating potential impacts. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper we describe a multiagent crime simulation model that resorts to concepts of self-organizing bio-inspired systems, in particular, of the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm. As the matching between simulated and real crime data distributions depends upon the tuning of some control parameters of the simulation model (in particular, of the initial places where criminals start out), we have modeled the calibration of the simulation as an optimization problem. The solution for the allocation of criminals into gateways is also undertaken by a bio-inspired method, namely, a customized Genetic Algorithm. We show that this approach allows for the automatic discovery of gateway configurations that, when employed in the simulation, produce crime distributions that are statistically close to those observed in real data.

AB In this paper, we study the effect of randomness in the decision making of agents on social learning. In the addressed system, the agents make decisions sequentially about the true state of nature. Each agent observes a signal produced according to one of two hypotheses, which represents the state of nature. The signals of all the agents are generated independently from the same state. The agents also know the decisions of all the previous agents in the network. The randomness in this paper is modeled by a policy that amounts to random mapping of the beliefs of the agents to the action space. We propose that the agents learn from the decisions of the previous agents and update their beliefs by using the Bayesian theory. We define the concept of social belief about the truthfulness of the two hypotheses and provide results on the convergence of the social belief. We also prove that with the proposed random policy, information cascade can be avoided and asymptotic learning occurs. We apply the random policy to data models that represent the observations by a distribution belonging to the exponential family. We then provide performance and convergence analysis of the proposed method as well as simulation results that include comparisons with deterministic and hybrid policies.

AB The effects of inactivation agents, including common polymeric aluminium (Al) chloride (CPAC) and Ecological Type PAC (UNIC), on phosphorus (P) released from sediment are unclear. To determine these effects, we performed seven experiments using various inactivation agent additions. The experimental schemes used were as follows: (1) CPAC, 15 mg Al L-1; (2) CPAC (15 mg Al L-1) + polyacrylamide (PAM) (0.5 mg L-1); (3) UNIC, 5 mg Al L-1; (4) UNIC, 15 mg Al L-1; (5) UNIC, 60 mg Al L-1; (6) control set without any inactivation agent addition; and (7) alkali shock load (the pH value of overlying water in the scheme 7 was adjusted to 11 by addition of sodium hydroxide to simulate alkali shock load at 13 days after CPAC addition). The experiments were conducted in glass columns, each containing 0.3 L sediment from Lake Dianchi and 3 L of overlying water. The results showed that P release rate decreased as the amount of inactivation agent added increased. P release rate was calculated according to each inactivation agent and the amount of inactivation agent added. Release rate found was in the decreasing order: (6) > (3) > (4) > (1) > (5) > (2). The corresponding rate was calculated to be 7.11, 6.16, 4.55, 1.76, 1.46 and 1.00 mg P m(-2) day(-1), respectively. Dissolved total P (DTP) was the main form of total P (TP) in the overlying water. After the addition of PAM, the DTP:TP ratio decreased while the dissolved inorganic P (DIP):DTP ratio increased. With increasing the amount of inactivation agents added, both DTP:TP and DIP:TP ratios decreased. Experimental group 3 had similar DTP:TP and DIP:TP ratios to experimental group 6. These results are significant in terms of the large-scale application of inactivation agents for reducing levels of bioreactive P. Alkali shock load (experimental group 7) caused failure in the inactivation of P by CPAC.

AB The study of tax behavior is a research field which attracts increasing interest in social and behavioral sciences. Rational choice models have been traditionally used to account for that behavior, but they face the puzzle of explaining levels of observed tax compliance which are much higher than expected. Several social influence mechanisms have been proposed in order to tackle this problem. In this article, we discuss the interdisciplinary literature on this topic, and we claim that agent-based models are a promising tool in order to test theories and hypothesise in this field. To illustrate that claim, we present SIMULFIS, an agent-based model for the simulation of tax compliance that allows to combine rational choice with social influence mechanisms in order to generate aggregated patterns of tax behavior. We present and discuss the results of a simple virtual experiment in order to show the potentialities of the model.

AB This paper presents a practical swarm navigation algorithm based on potential functions and properties of inviscid incompressible flows. Panel methods are used to solve the flow equations around complex shaped obstacles and to generate the flowlines, which provide collision-free paths to the goal position. Safe swarm navigation is achieved by following the generated streamlines. Potential functions are used to achieve and maintain group cohesion or a geometric formation during navigation. The algorithm is implemented and tested through numerical simulations, as well as experimental implementations on real robots in a laboratory environment in two settings, in which the flowlines are calculated either offline or in real time. The algorithm is easy to implement and can serve as an effective tool for cohesive navigation of robotic swarms.

AB An important puzzle in social network research is to explain how macro-level structures emerge from micro-level network processes. Explaining the emergence and stability of structural groups in social networks is particularly difficult for two reasons. First, because groups are characterized both by high connectedness within (group cohesion) and lack of connectedness between them (group boundaries). Second, because a large number of theoretical micro-level network processes contribute to their emergence. We argue that traditional social network theories that are concerned with the evolution of positive relations (forces of attraction) are not sufficient to explain the emergence of groups because they lack mechanisms explaining the emergence of group boundaries. Models that additionally account for the evolution of negative ties (forces of repulsion) may be better suited to explain the emergence and stability of groups. We build a theoretical model and illustrate its usefulness by fitting stochastic actor-oriented models (SAOMs) to empirical data of co-evolving networks of friendship and dislike among 479 secondary-school students. The SAOMs include a number of newly developed effects expressing the co-evolution between positive and negative ties. We then simulate networks from the estimated models to explore the micro-macro link. We find that a model that considers forces of attraction and repulsion simultaneously is better at explaining groups in social networks. In the long run, however, the empirically informed simulations generate networks that are too stylized to be realistic, raising further questions about model degeneracy and time heterogeneity of group processes.

AB Selectively attributing beliefs to specific agents is core to reasoning about other people and imagining oneself in different states. Evidence suggests humans might achieve this by simulating each other's computations in agent-specific neural circuits, but it is not known how circuits become agent-specific. Here we investigate whether agent-specificity adapts to social context. We train subjects on social learning tasks, manipulating the frequency with which self and other see the same information. Training alters the agent-specificity of prediction error (PE) circuits for at least 24h, modulating the extent to which another agent's PE is experienced as one's own and influencing perspective-taking in an independent task. Ventromedial prefrontal myelin density, indexed by magnetisation transfer, correlates with the strength of this adaptation. We describe a frontotemporal learning network, which exploits relationships between different agents' computations. Our findings suggest that Self-Other boundaries are learnable variables, shaped by the statistical structure of social experience.

AB Non-woven nanofiber web with high surface areas and abundant functional groups were fabricated through electrospinning and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) in order to develop functional non-woven nanofiber webs for detoxifying simulant of chemical warfare agents. Functional groups that can hydrolysis diisopropyl fluorophosphate (simulant of G-series agents) were selectively modified onto the electrospun PAN nanofibers without causing deterioration of the fiber morphology. In order to achieve the most suitable conditions for functionalization, the CVD reaction temperature was adjusted and various functional groups were introduced. Here, CVD of ethylene diamine at 120 degrees C of reaction temperature shows the best detoxifying efficiency against diisopropyl fluorophosphates (DFP), which is simulant of G-series chemical warfare agent (complete removal of DFP within 24 h under humid condition). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations clarified the optimized functional groups for effectively detoxifying nerve gas agent (G types). Both of simulation and experimental results prove that the co-existence of hydroxyl and amine groups will be beneficial in detoxifying reaction (over 80% decomposition within 4 h).

AB As agent-based modelling gains popularity, the demand for transparency in underlying modelling assumptions grows. Behavioural rules guiding agents' decisions, learning, interactions and possible changes in these should rely on solid theoretical and empirical grounds. This field has matured enough to reach the point at which we need to go beyond just reporting what social theory we base these rules upon. Many social science theories operate with various abstract constructions such as attitudes, perceptions, norms or intentions. These concepts are rather subjective and remain open to interpretation when operationalizing them in a formal model code. There is a growing concern that how modellers interpret qualitative social science theories in quantitative ABMs may differ from case to case. Yet, formal tests of these differences are scarce and a systematic approach to analyse any possible disagreements is lacking. Our paper addresses this gap by exploring the consequences of variations in formalizations of one social science theory on the simulation outcomes of agent-based models of the same class. We ran simulations to test the impact of four differences: in model architecture concerning specific equations and their sequence within one theory, in factors affecting agents' decisions, in representation of these potentially differing factors , and finally in the underlying distribution of data used in a model. We illustrate emergent outcomes of these differences using an agent-based model developed to study regional impacts of households' solar panel investment decisions. The Theory of Planned Behaviour was applied as one of the most common social science theories used to define behavioural rules of individual agents. Our findings demonstrate qualitative and quantitative differences in simulation outcomes, even when agents' decision rules are based on the same theory and data. The paper outlines a number of critical methodological implications for future developments in agent-based modelling.

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

ID MOVEMENT; GEOMETRY; DYNAMICS; BEHAVIOR
AB The selfish herd hypothesis explains how social prey can assemble cohesive groups for maximising individual fitness. However, previous models often abstracted away the physical manifestation of the focal animals such that the influence of getting stuck in a crowded herd on individual adaptation was less intensively investigated. Here, we propose an evolutionary model to simulate the adaptation of egoistic social prey to predation given that individual mobility is strictly restrained by the presence of other conspecifics. In our simulated evolutionary races, agents were set to either be confined by neighbours or move to empty cells on the lattice, and the behavioural traits of those less exposed were selected and inherited. Our analyses show that under this crowded environment, cohesive and steady herds were consistently replaced by morphing and moving aggregates via the attempt of border agents to share predation risk with the inner members. This kind of collective motion emerges purely from the competition among selfish individuals regardless of any group benefit. Our findings reveal that including the crowding effect with the selfish herd scenario permits additional diversity in the predicted outcomes and imply that a wider set of collective animal behaviours are explainable purely by individual-level selection.

AB Understanding human institutions, animal cultures and other social systems requires flexible formalisms that describe how their members change them from within. We introduce a framework for modelling how agents change the games they participate in. We contrast this between-game 'institutional evolution' with the more familiar within-game 'behavioural evolution'. We model institutional change by following small numbers of persistent agents as they select and play a changing series of games. Starting from an initial game, a group of agents trace trajectories through game space by navigating to increasingly preferable games until they converge on 'attractor' games. Agents use their 'institutional preferences' for game features (such as stability, fairness and efficiency) to choose between neighbouring games. We use this framework to pose a pressing question: what kinds of games does institutional evolution select for; what is in the attractors? After computing institutional change trajectories over the two-player space, we find that attractors have disproportionately fair outcomes, even though the agents who produce them are strictly self-interested and indifferent to fairness. This seems to occur because game fairness co-occurs with the self-serving features these agents do actually prefer. We thus present institutional evolution as a mechanism for encouraging the spontaneous emergence of cooperation among small groups of inherently selfish agents, without space, reputation, repetition, or other more familiar mechanisms. Game space trajectories provide a flexible, testable formalism for modelling the interdependencies of behavioural and institutional evolutionary processes, as well as a mechanism for the evolution of cooperation.

AB We propose a model based on a population of agents whose states represent either hostile or peaceful behavior. Randomly selected pairs of agents interact according to a variation of the Prisoners Dilemma game, and the probabilities that the agents behave aggressively or not are constantly updated by the model so that the agents that remain in the game are those with the highest fitness. We show that the population of agents oscillate between generalized conflict and global peace, without either reaching a stable state. We then use this model to explain some of the emergent behaviors in collective conflicts, by comparing the simulated results with empirical data obtained from social systems. In particular, using public data reports we show how the model precisely reproduces interesting quantitative characteristics of diverse types of armed conflicts, public protests, riots and strikes.

AB Two experiments addressed the questions of if and how normative social influence operates in anonymous computer-mediated communication (CMC) and human-computer interaction (HCI). In Experiment 1, a 2 (public response vs. private response) x 2 (one interactant vs. four interactants) x 3 (textbox vs. stick figure vs. animated character) mixed-design experiment (N = 72), we investigated how conformity pressure operates in a simulated CMC setting. Each participant was asked to make a decision in hypothetical social dilemmas after being presented with a unanimous opinion by other (ostensible) participants. The experiment examined how the visual representation of interaction partners on the screen moderates this social influence process. Group conformity effects were shown to be more salient when the participant's responses were allegedly seen by others, compared to when the responses were given in private. In addition, participants attributed greater competence, social attractiveness, and trustworthiness to partners represented by anthropomorphic characters than those represented by textboxes or stick figures. Experiment 2 replicated Experiment 1, replacing interaction with a computer(s) rather than (ostensible) people, to create an interaction setting in which no normative pressure was expected to occur. The perception of interaction partner (human vs. computer) moderated the group conformity effect such that people expressed greater public agreement with human partners than with computers. No such difference was found for the private expression of opinion. As expected, the number of computer agents did not affect participants' opinions whether the responses were given in private or in public, while visual representation had a significant impact on both conformity measures and source perception variables.

AB Drinking events are dynamic. The interactions of individuals, groups, and the environment as they relate to drinking behaviour are overwhelmingly complex. This paper presents an empirically grounded dynamic conceptual model to better understand drinking events. Using a collaborative mixed-methods approach, we developed an aggregated system dynamic model of drinking events. The process began with identification of system elements and boundaries. Once the first aspects of the model were completed, we constructed a causal loop diagram, an aggregated causal loop diagram, and stock and flow diagrams. Finally, we developed and ran computer simulations of the dynamical models. The model presented here can be used to guide future agent-based, system dynamics, or differential equation-based models. Such models can help inform future empirical work and modelling to increase the understanding of drinking events and provide solutions to the problems that happen proximal to these events.

AB The assessment of seismic risk at urban scale does not actually consider aspects related to human behaviours, unlike other kind of events; moreover, the simulation of phases of pedestrian evacuation and motion in earthquake evacuation is a rarely inquired issue. From this point of view, this work proposes an innovative approach to earthquake evacuation, presenting an agent based model to describe phases and rules of motion for pedestrians. The model is based on the analysis of videotapes concerning real events. Results firstly show a scheme of chronological organisation of experimentally noticed behaviours activated during an earthquake evacuation. Secondly, the related behavioural agent-based model is presented by using the i* language and posing attention to relationships between pedestrians and environment. A particular attention is given to the relationships in evacuation paths choice depending on configuration of environment and damage distribution after earthquake. Additionally, experimental values of distance between people and evacuation average speed in the first phases of outdoor motion are provided. The mathematical definitions for the model and the software implementation of the model will be implemented. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Charged and uncharged solutes penetrate through cartilage to maintain the metabolic function of chondrocytes and to possibly restore or further breakdown the cartilage tissue in different stages of osteoarthritis. In this study the transport of charged solutes across the various zones of cartilage was quantified, taken into account the physicochemical interactions between the solute and the cartilage constituents. A multiphasic finite-bath finite element (FE) model was developed to simulate equine cartilage diffusion experiments that used a negatively charged contrast agent (ioxaglate) in combination with serial micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) to measure the diffusion. By comparing the FE model with the experimental data both the diffusion coefficient of ioxaglate and the fixed charge density (FCD) were obtained. In the multiphasic model, cartilage was divided into multiple (three) zones to help understand how diffusion coefficient and FCD vary across cartilage thickness. The direct effects of charged solute-FCD interaction on diffusion were investigated by comparing the diffusion coefficients derived from the multiphasic and biphasic-solute models. We found a relationship between the FCD obtained by the multiphasic model and ioxaglate partitioning obtained from micro-CT experiments. Using our multi-zone multiphasic model, diffusion coefficient of the superficial zone was up to ten-fold higher than that of the middle zone, while the FCD of the middle zone was up to almost two-fold higher than that of the superficial zone. In conclusion, the developed finite-bath multiphasic model provides us with a non-destructive method by which we could obtain both diffusion coefficient and FCD of different cartilage zones. The outcomes of the current work will also help understand how charge of the bath affects the diffusion of a charged molecule and also predict the diffusion behavior of a charged solute across articular cartilage.

AB The observation that suicides sometimes cluster in space and/or time has led to suggestions that these clusters are caused by the social learning of suicide-related behaviours, or "copycat suicides". Point clusters are clusters of suicides localised in both time and space, and have been attributed to direct social learning from nearby individuals. Mass clusters are clusters of suicides localised in time but not space, and have been attributed to the dissemination of information concerning celebrity suicides via the mass media. Here, agent-based simulations, in combination with scan statistic methods for detecting clusters of rare events, were used to clarify the social learning processes underlying point and mass clusters. It was found that social learning between neighbouring agents did generate point clusters as predicted, although this effect was partially mimicked by homophily (individuals preferentially assorting with similar others). The one-to-many transmission dynamics characterised by the mass media were shown to generate mass clusters, but only where social learning was weak, perhaps due to prestige bias (only copying prestigious celebrities) and similarity bias (only copying similar models) acting to reduce the subset of available models. These findings can help to clarify and formalise existing hypotheses and to guide future empirical work relating to real-life copycat suicides.

AB A proper understanding of how complex networks grow is important to get insights into the network structure, make predictions of future growth, and enable simulation of large networks. In this paper, we focus on social networks and try to understand, capture and predict dynamic behaviors on social networks. How social networks evolve, i.e. how individuals create and deactivate social ties? It is interesting for several areas such as marketing, web search and recommendation.
   We propose an agent-based model in which agents represent individuals and social networks evolve driven by events and interests. The model, which we call EIM (Event-Interest Model), incorporates an intuitive idea: individuals begin to interact when participating in the same event, and social ties are formed or reinforced between two individuals if they have similar interests and would like to link to each other.
   Our model matches better to realistic network structure in terms of a number of statistical properties and critical patterns compared with some recent models for social networks, which suggests that both events and interests may play an important role in shaping the evolution of social networks.

AB Songbirds that follow a conspecific attraction strategy in the habitat selection process prefer to settle in habitat patches already occupied by other individuals. This largely affects the patterns of their spatio-temporal distribution and leads to clustered breeding. Although making informed settlement decisions is expected to be beneficial for individuals, such territory clusters may potentially provide additional fitness benefits (e.g., through the dilution effect) or costs (e.g., possibly facilitating nest localization if predators respond functionally to prey distribution). Thus, we hypothesized that the fitness consequences of following a conspecific attraction strategy may largely depend on the composition of the predator community. We developed an agent-based model in which we simulated the settling behavior of birds that use a conspecific attraction strategy and breed in a multi-predator landscape with predators that exhibited different foraging strategies. Moreover, we investigated whether Bayesian updating of prior settlement decisions according to the perceived predation risk may improve the fitness of birds that rely on conspecific cues. Our results provide evidence that the fitness consequences of conspecific attraction are predation-related. We found that in landscapes dominated by predators able to respond functionally to prey distribution, clustered breeding led to fitness costs. However, this cost could be reduced if birds performed Bayesian updating of prior settlement decisions and perceived nesting with too many neighbors as a threat. Our results did not support the hypothesis that in landscapes dominated by incidental predators, clustered breeding as a byproduct of conspecific attraction provides fitness benefits through the dilution effect. We suggest that this may be due to the spatial scale of songbirds' aggregative behavior. In general, we provide evidence that when considering the fitness consequences of conspecific attraction for songbirds, one should expect a trade-off between the benefits of making informed decisions and the costs of clustering.

AB The dynamics of the model of agents with limited confidence introduced by Hegselmann and Krause exhibits multiple well-separated regimes characterised by the number of distinct clusters in the stationary state. We present indications that there are genuine dynamical phase transitions between these regimes. The main indicator is the divergence of the average evolution time required to reach the stationary state. The slowdown close to the transition is connected with the emergence of the groups of mediator agents which are very small but have decisive role in the process of social convergence. More detailed study shows that the histogram of the evolution times is composed of several peaks. These peaks are unambiguously interpreted as corresponding to mediator groups consisting of one, two, three etc. agents. Detailed study reveals that each transition possesses also an internal fine structure.

AB Transforming Growth Factor (TGF-beta 1) is a member of the TGF-beta superfamily ligand-receptor network. and plays a crucial role in tissue regeneration. The extensive in vitro and in vivo experimental literature describing its actions nevertheless describe an apparent paradox in that during re-epithelialisation it acts as proliferation inhibitor for keratinocytes. The majority of biological models focus on certain aspects of TGF-beta 1 behaviour and no one model provides a comprehensive story of this regulatory factor's action. Accordingly our aim was to develop a computational model to act as a complementary approach to improve our understanding of TGF-beta 1. In our previous study, an agent-based model of keratinocyte colony formation in 2D culture was developed. In this study this model was extensively developed into a three dimensional multiscale model of the human epidermis which is comprised of three interacting and integrated layers: (1) an agent-based model which captures the biological rules governing the cells in the human epidermis at the cellular level and includes the rules for injury induced emergent behaviours, (2) a COmplex PAthway SImulator (COPASI) model which simulates the expression and signalling of TGF-beta 1 at the sub-cellular level and (3) a mechanical layer embodied by a numerical physical solver responsible for resolving the forces exerted between cells at the multi-cellular level. The integrated model was initially validated by using it to grow a piece of virtual epidermis in 3D and comparing the in virtuo simulations of keratinocyte behaviour and of TGF-beta 1 signalling with the extensive research literature describing this key regulatory protein. This research reinforces the idea that computational modelling can be an effective additional tool to aid our understanding of complex systems. In the accompanying paper the model is used to explore hypotheses of the functions of TGF-beta 1 at the cellular and subcellular level on different keratinocyte populations during epidermal wound healing.

AB Many studies show that the human energy-related behaviors have a significant impact on the return of Energy Efficiency Programs (EEPs). However, studies that aimed at increasing the energy savings from the EEPs are still limited. In this paper, a Genetic Agent-Based (GAB) framework has been proposed to enhance the return of a typical EEP by simulating social network and energy behavior attributes and finding the best participants among a target community. Several attributes are considered for creating the agent-based model of households and numerically representing their interactions with the EEP or within their social network. The improvement of the EEP using the GAB framework is tested on a social network consisting of 56 households. The simulation results show that by accurately selecting participants using the presented framework, the amount of energy saving could increase up to ten times. This ultimately indicates the considerable impact of the social network on the EEP performance. In other words, to have an efficient EEP in the long term, the social network attributes such as network degree and strength of connections should be also considered in decision-making along with the energy-related attributes.

AB Despite the very positive - as measured by market surveys - attitude towards eco-innovations and sustainability in general, the actual market penetration of green products and practices generally falls behind the expectations. In this paper we argue that considering difficulty of engagement, as used in the Campbell Paradigm, is of critical importance when modeling diffusion of eco-innovations. Such a notion of difficulty possesses three desired properties: (i) parsimony - it is represented by a single value, (ii) interpretability - it can be regarded as an estimator of the otherwise complex,notion of behavioral cost, and (iii) applicability - it can be easily measured through market surveys. In an extensive simulation and analytical study involving empirically measured difficulty and an agent-based model spanned on different social network structures, we show that innovation adoption may exhibit abrupt changes in market penetration as a result of even small changes in difficulty. The latter may be of particular interest to policy makers who have to make strategic decisions when introducing socially - but not necessarily individually - desired products and practices, like dynamic or green electricity tariffs.

AB Computer simulation allows for the experimental study of dynamic interactions between human behavior and complex environmental systems. Behavioral determinants and processes as identified in social-scientific theory may be formalized in simulated agents to obtain a better understanding of man-environment interactions and of policy measures aimed at managing these interactions. A number of exemplary agent-based simulation studies is discussed to demonstrate how simulations can be used to identify behavioral determinants and processes underlying environmental problems, and to explore the possible effects of policy strategies. Finally, we highlight how agent-based simulation may contribute to our understanding of the dynamics of environmental resources, and how to manage them in a sustainable way.

AB Opinion dynamics have received significant attention in recent years. This paper proposes a bounded confidence opinion model for a group of agents with two different confidence levels. Each agent in the population is endowed with a confidence interval around her opinion with radius alpha d or (1 - alpha)d, where alpha is an element of (0, 1/2] represents the differentiation of confidence levels. We analytically derived the critical confidence bound d(c) = 1/(4 alpha) for the two-level opinion dynamics on Z. A single opinion cluster is formed with probability 1 above this critical value regardless of the ratio p of agents with high/low confidence. Extensive numerical simulations are performed to illustrate our theoretical results. Noticed is a clear impact of p on the collective behavior: more agents with high confidence lead to harder agreement. It is also experimentally revealed that the sharpness of the threshold de increases with a but does not depend on p.

AB In the field of electricity markets, the development of training tools for engineers has been extremely useful. A novel experimental economics approach based on a computational Web platform of an electricity market is proposed here for the practical teaching of electrical engineering students. The approach is designed to diminish the gap that exists between theory and practice in this field, through a methodological strategy for teaching/learning called "simulation." In the proposed simulation exercise, groups of students operate as market agents and have the freedom to create their own strategies. Additionally, a theoretical model and a specific simulation tool are used for the evaluation of the proposed strategies. The test system is based on the market structure of the Chilean wholesale electricity market and was tested on student groups at two universities. Based on the students' performance, the strategic behavior of agents and their impact on market price evolution are described and analyzed. Student assessment supports the conclusion that the proposed experimental economics framework offers a useful mechanism in student practical work for understanding and explaining the observed phenomena.

TI Effects of dynamical grouping on cooperation in N-person evolutionary
   snowdrift game
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
LA English
DT Article
ID NETWORKS; BEHAVIOR; DRIVEN
AB A population typically consists of agents that continually distribute themselves into different groups at different times. This dynamic grouping has recently been shown to be essential in explaining many features observed in human activities including social, economic, and military activities. We study the effects of dynamic grouping on the level of cooperation in a modified evolutionary N-person snowdrift game. Due to the formation of dynamical groups, the competition takes place in groups of different sizes at different times and players of different strategies are mixed by the grouping dynamics. It is found that the level of cooperation is greatly enhanced by the dynamic grouping of agents, when compared with a static population of the same size. As a parameter beta, which characterizes the relative importance of the reward and cost, increases, the fraction of cooperative players f(C) increases and it is possible to achieve a fully cooperative state. Analytically, we present a dynamical equation that incorporates the effects of the competing game and group size distribution. The distribution of cooperators in different groups is assumed to be a binomial distribution, which is confirmed by simulations. Results from the analytic equation are in good agreement with numerical results from simulations. We also present detailed simulation results of f(C) over the parameter space spanned by the probabilities of group coalescence nu(m) and group fragmentation nu(p) in the grouping dynamics. A high nu(m) and low nu(p) promotes cooperation, and a favorable reward characterized by a high beta would lead to a fully cooperative state.

AB Several evolutionary mechanisms have been proposed to explain how natural selection leads to cooperation between competing individuals. Social dilemmas modelled with the aid of game theory capture the essence of this problem, and computer simulation is usually the technique used to test and formalise those explanatory mechanisms. However, scarce attention has been paid to what the notion of 'mechanisms' means and involves in the literature. Also, the key issue about when a computer simulation provides a good explanation tends to be ignored. In this article, we tackle these two drawbacks in the literature by calling attention to the implications of the notion of 'social mechanism' along different conceptual dimensions, such as ontological status, regularity, transparency, intelligibility, and reduction. We also claim that computer simulation, and specially agent-based modelling, provides a plausible explanation to social cooperation only if it satisfies some criteria of empirical adequacy instead of just being capable of generating cooperation in a virtual system. Finally, we relate these issues to five evolutionary mechanisms that explain the evolution of cooperation. We review and briefly describe the literature on these mechanisms, and we explain their most important features, how they are to be considered along the conceptual dimensions used to describe the notion of mechanism, what is the empirical and computational evidence to support them, and which are the shortcomings that each of them has as explanatory hypotheses for the evolution of cooperation.

AB From inmates in prison gangs to soldiers in elite units, the intimidating reputation of groups often precedes its members. While individual reputation is known to affect people's aggressiveness, whether one's group reputation can similarly influence behavior in conflict situations is yet to be established. Using an economic game experiment, we isolate the effect of group reputation on aggression and conflict from that of individual reputation. We find that group reputation can increase the willingness to inflict costs on others but only when individuals are able to punish their fellow members. Even if internal discipline can sustain their shared reputation, more intimidating groups provide fewer benefits to their members in the short run. Using an agent-based simulation, we show that this might not be the case in the long run. Our findings yield insights into the effects of group reputation on aggression, conflict, and possible consequences for group survival.

DE evolutionary minority game; self-adaptation; self-segregation in
   population; self-clustering in population
AB In this paper, we shall present our studies of a generalized evolutionary minority game model in which the agents are divided into several groups. The performance of the individual agent is averaged in each group. We find that there are three different effects in this generalized model, i.e. (1) group averaging effect, (2) left-right asymmetric effect, and (3) self-interaction effect. The former two effects favor the cautious agents, while the last one favors the extreme agents. In most cases, both the analytic results and the numerical simulations demonstrate that the group averaging effect is dominantly important and therefore the performance of the cautious agents is better than that of the extreme agents. However, when the number of groups is sufficiently large, the generalized model can be somehow reduced to the conventional evolutionary minority game model. As the parameters vary in the generalized model, the importance of the above three effects is exchangeable and different types of population distribution emerge.

ID OPINION DYNAMICS; STATISTICAL PHYSICS
AB In this work, we study the opinion dynamics of the Sznajd model with anticonformity on a fully-connected network. We consider four agents with two different configurations; three against one (3-1) and two against two (2-2). We consider two different individual behaviors, conformity and anticonformity, and observe the effect on the critical behavior of the model. We analyze the differences between the phase transitions that occur for both agent configurations. We find that both agent configurations have a different critical point. The critical point of the 3-1 agent is smaller than that of the 2-2 agent configuration. From the simulation and analytical result, we find that the critical point for the 3-1 occurs at p(c) = 0.2, and for the 2-2, at p(c) = 0.5. From the social viewpoint, the consensus process in a population is faster with a larger influencer in the same number of small group of the population. In addition, we find the critical exponents for both configurations are the same, that are beta approximate to 0.5, gamma approximate to 1 and v approximate to 2. Our results suggest that both models are identical and in the mean-field Ising universality class.

AB Distributed constraint satisfaction problems (DisCSPs) are composed of agents, each holding its own variables, that are connected by constraints to variables of other agents. Due to the distributed nature of the problem, message delay can have unexpected effects on the behavior of distributed search algorithms on DisCSPs. This has been recently shown in experimental studies of asynchronous backtracking algorithms (Bejar et al., Artif. Intell., 161:117-148, 2005; Silaghi and Faltings, Artif. Intell., 161:25-54, 2005). To evaluate the impact of message delay on the run of DisCSP search algorithms, a model for distributed performance measures is presented. The model counts the number of non concurrent constraints checks, to arrive at a solution, as a non concurrent measure of distributed computation. A simpler version measures distributed computation cost by the non-concurrent number of steps of computation. An algorithm for computing these distributed measures of computational effort is described. The realization of the model for measuring performance of distributed search algorithms is a simulator which includes the cost of message delays. Two families of distributed search algorithms on DisCSPs are investigated. Algorithms that run a single search process, and multiple search processes algorithms. The two families of algorithms are described and associated with existing algorithms. The performance of three representative algorithms of these two families is measured on randomly generated instances of DisCSPs with delayed messages. The delay of messages is found to have a strong negative effect on single search process algorithms, whether synchronous or asynchronous. Multi search process algorithms, on the other hand, are affected very lightly by message delay.

DE Social learning; Agent-based model; Directed social learning
AB Animals use heuristic strategies to determine from which conspecifics to learn socially. This leads to directed social learning. Directed social learning protects them from copying non-adaptive information so far, the strategies of animals. leading to directed social learning, are assumed to rely on (possibly indirect) inferences about the demonstrator's success. As ail alternative to this assumption, we propose a strategy that only uses self-established estimates of the pay-offs of behavior. We evaluate the strategy in a number of agent-based simulations. Critically, the strategy's success is warranted by the inclusion of all incremental learning mechanism. Our findings point out new theoretical opportunities to regulate social learning for animals. More broadly, our simulations emphasize the need to include a realistic learning mechanism in game-theoretic studies of social learning strategies, and call for re-evaluation of previous findings.

AB The present study explores the idea that human linguistic communication co-opted a pre-existing population-wide behavioural system that was shared among social group members and whose structure reflected the structure of the environment. This system is hypothesized to have emerged from interactions among individuals who had evolved the capacity to imitate arbitrary, functionless behaviour. A series of agent-based computer simulations test the separate and joint effects of imitation, pattern completion behaviour, environment structure and level of social interaction on such a population-wide behavioural system. The results support the view that a system that could be co-opted for linguistic communication might arise in a population of agents equipped with arbitrary imitation for the purposes of pattern completion interacting in certain kinds of structured environments. Such pre-linguistic behavioural system could have bootstrapped communication and paved the way for biological capacities widely believed to be necessary for communication, such as shared intentionality and symbolicity, to evolve.

AB Within the field of Criminology, the spatio-temporal dynamics of crime are an important subject of study. In this area, typical questions are how the behaviour of offenders, targets, and guardians can be explained and predicted, as well as the emergence and displacement of criminal hot spots. In this article we present a combination of software tools that can be used as an experimental environment to address such questions. In particular, these tools comprise an agent-based simulation model, a verification tool, and a visualisation tool. The agent-based simulation model specifically focuses on the interplay between hot spots and reputation. Using this environment, a large number of simulation runs have been performed, of which results have been formally analysed. Based on these results, we argue that the presented environment offers a valuable approach to analyse the dynamics of criminal hot spots.

AB Mountain communities in developing and transitioning countries are experiencing a period of rapid social, economic, and environmental change. While change has long been a feature of mountain life, the rate, magnitude, nature, and number of the transformations now taking place is unprecedented, with profound implications for the sustainability and welfare of mountain communities in the coming years. It is therefore vital that their potential impacts be understood. Considering stressors in isolation can give a false picture as each stressor alters the context within which the other stressors are operating. Holistic approaches are needed. In this paper, a variety of stressors are concurrently simulated within an empirically informed agent-based model of a rural Nepalese mountain community so that their combined impact can be studied. The potential effect of changing fertility rates, increasing crop yield variability, and earthquakes on household finances is considered for the period 2015-2030. Results show that higher fertility rates, increased crop yield variability, and earthquakes all have negative long-term effects on household finances, and that each of these stressors compounds the effect of the other stressors in an additive fashion. Results further highlight heterogeneity in the capacity of households to cope with stressors and demonstrate the important role that happenstance can play in exacerbating the effect of stressors. Our findings suggest that development practitioners should explicitly take multiple stressors into account when considering interventions. They should also contemplate improved microtargeting of households to increase aid effectiveness over the longer term, while recognising that household vulnerability is often dynamic.

AB Advances in multiagent simulation techniques make it possible to study more realistic dynamics of complex systems and allow evolutionary theories to be tested. Here I use simulations to assess the relative importance of reproductive systems (haplodiploidy vs. diploidy), mate selection (assortative mating vs. random mating) and social economics (pay-off matrices of evolutionary games) in the evolutionary dynamics leading to the emergence of social cooperation in the provision of parental care. The simulations confirm that haplo-diploid organisms and organisms mating assortatively have a higher probability for fixing alleles and require less favorable conditions for their fixation, than diploids or organisms mating randomly. The simulations showed that social behavior was most likely to emerge a) when the cost for parental investment was much lower than the benefits to the offspring, b) when cooperation improved synergistically the fitness of offspring compared to the corresponding egoistic behavior and c) when alleles coding for altruistic or social behavior could be rapidly fixed in the population, thanks to mechanisms such as haplo-diploidy and/or assortative mating. Cooperative social behavior always appeared if sociality conferred much higher fitness gains compared to non cooperative alternatives suggesting that the most important factors for the emergence and maintenance of social behavior are those based on energetic or efficiency considerations. The simulations, in congruence with the scant experimental evidence available, suggest that economic considerations rather than genetic ones are critical in explaining the emergence and maintenance of sociality.

AB Objectives We test the effects of four policy scenarios on recruitment into organized crime. The policy scenarios target (i) organized crime leaders and (ii) facilitators for imprisonment, (iii) provide educational and welfare support to children and their mothers while separating them from organized-crime fathers, and (iv) increase educational and social support to at-risk schoolchildren. Methods We developed a novel agent-based model drawing on theories of peer effects (differential association, social learning), social embeddedness of organized crime, and the general theory of crime. Agents are simultaneously embedded in multiple social networks (household, kinship, school, work, friends, and co-offending) and possess heterogeneous individual attributes. Relational and individual attributes determine the probability of offending. Co-offending with organized crime members determines recruitment into the criminal group. All the main parameters are calibrated on data from Palermo or Sicily (Italy). We test the effect of the four policy scenarios against a baseline no-intervention scenario on the number of newly recruited and total organized crime members using Generalized Estimating Equations models. Results The simulations generate realistic outcomes, with relatively stable organized crime membership and crime rates. All simulated policy interventions reduce the total number of members, whereas all but primary socialization reduce newly recruited members. The intensity of the effects, however, varies across dependent variables and models. Conclusions Agent-based models effectively enable to develop theoretically driven and empirically calibrated simulations of organized crime. The simulations can fill the gaps in evaluation research in the field of organized crime and allow us to test different policies in different environmental contexts.

AB This article presents a new method of examining the impact of climate change on tourism using the example of ski areas. To date, the consequences of climate change have mostly been investigated at high levels of aggregation in space and time, such as countries and years. Detailed analyses are essential, however, because different regions are affected to varying degrees. Within a complex model incorporating feedback between various system components, such as hydrological and climatic processes as well as demography and economy, possible developments of various sectors are simulated in the Upper Danube watershed in central Europe. Using a multiagent approach, we rise to the challenge to take both socioeconomic and natural aspects into account and enable the simulation of human system reaction and adaptation to climate change. The presented approach is an adequate way to consider the fact that within human-environment systems, environmental changes influence human living conditions and vice versa. We use a multiagent system, in combination with different climate and societal scenarios, to investigate the supply-side operating ability of tourism facilities and the demand-side reactions. Thus, we can calculate the tourism water demand, which is not recorded in official statistics. We present and discuss selected results for ski areas, such as the regionally differentiated development of tourism water consumption and overnight stays' trends. With their high level of individualization, the tourism model simulation results foster the finding of economically reasonable investment strategies. In addition, the tourism model results give rise to future research, such as tourism demand-side examinations concerning the perception of climate change, and resulting behavioral shifts.

AB Institutional arrangements are considered necessary for successfully governing the commons. They are considered to be most effective if they are self-organized rather than imposed from outside. However, endogenous institutional arrangements, such as local norms, are specific to a particular socio-ecological system (SES). This paper presents a SES model of communal livestock producers in South Africa. Its biophysical component accounts for the impact of biotic and abiotic factors on livestock population. The social agent-based component models individual and socially determined behaviour, the latter of which is a social norm specific to the case. Model results show that when cooperative agents obey and sanction the norm, there is less likelihood of SES collapse in terms of livestock population crashes. However, cooperation among agents only emerges in times of ecological crisis where social reorganization is fostered. The crisis creates an opportunity for initializing a self-enforcing process of mutual cooperation. Model specifications are based on survey data, and agents were parameterized according to individual household data. A sensitivity analysis shows that this empirical heterogeneity cannot be reduced without changing model outcomes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The strategies adopted by individuals to select relevant information to pass on are central to understanding problem solving by groups. Here we use agent-based simulations to revisit a cooperative problem-solving scenario where the task is to find the common card in decks distributed to the group members. The agents can display only a sample of their cards and we explore different strategies to select those samples based on the confidences assigned to the cards. An agent's confidence that a particular card is the correct one is given by the number of times it observed that card in the decks of the other agents. We use a Gibbs distribution to select the card samples with the temperature measuring the strength of a noise that prevents the agents to correctly rank the cards. The group is guaranteed to find the common card in all runs solely in the infinite temperature limit, where the cards are sampled regardless of their confidences. In this case, we obtain the scaling form of the time constant that characterizes the asymptotic exponential decay of the failure probability. For finite time, however, a finite temperature yields a probability of failure that is several orders of magnitude lower than in the infinite temperature limit. The available experimental results are consistent with the decision-making model for finite temperature only.

AB Background. Hemorrhage is the second leading cause of death in civilian trauma and the leading cause of preventable death in military trauma. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of three hemostatic agents: BleedArrest, TraumaDex, and Celox.
   Materials and Methods. This was a prospective, experimental study using male Yorkshire swine. The pigs (n = 5 per group) were randomly assigned to one of the following: BleedArrest, TraumaDex, Celox, or control. To simulate a trauma injury, the investigators generated a complex groin injury with transection of the femoral artery and vein in all pigs. After 1 min of uncontrolled hemorrhage, one of the hemostatic agents was poured into the wound, followed by standard wound packing. The control group underwent the same procedures with the exception of the hemostatic agents. In all groups, 5 min of direct manual pressure was applied to the wound followed by a standard pressure dressing. After 30 min, dressings were removed, and the amount of bleeding was determined.
   Results. There were significant differences between the BleedArrest(mean = 21.2, SD +/- 36.6 mL) TraumaDex (mean = 68, SD +/- 103.5 mL) and Celox (mean = 18.16, SD +/- 41.6 mL) groups compared with Control group (mean = 230, SD +/- 154 mL) (P < 0.05). However, there were no statistically significant difference between BleedArrest, TraumaDex, and Celox groups (P = 0.478).
   Conclusions. BleedArrest, Celox, and TraumaDex were statistically and clinically superior at controlling hemorrhage compared with the standard pressure dressing in the control group. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB While prior research has examined the effects of interactive e-commerce avatars that simulate the roles of virtual assistants and recommender agents, there is lack of empirical study that investigates the effects of non-interactive talking avatars in e-commerce. This is unfortunate, as many websites today utilize non-interactive talking avatars that provide one-way dialogue in the forms of greetings, introduction of the company, and description of products and services offered. To bridge this gap, our study aims to investigate the effects of non-interactive talking avatar on perceptions of social presence, credibility, website trust, and patronage intention in an online store. Comparing between the experimental (website with avatar) and control (website without avatar) conditions, the experimental results showed that perceived social presence was significantly enhanced by the presence of the non-interactive talking avatar. Furthermore, the presence of the avatar had positive effects on website trust and patronage intention among male participants; but had negative effects on perceptions of information credibility and website patronage intention among females. Analysis based on participants' comments suggests that females were more critical towards certain shortcomings of the non-interactive talking avatar; citing limited interactivity and artificial dialogue from text-to-speech engine. Additionally, the comment analysis suggests that females preferred processing textual over auditory information (as spoken by the avatar) about the products in the online store. Theoretical and managerial implications related to non-interactive talking avatars are discussed in this paper.

AB Agent-based modeling (ABM) techniques for studying human-technical systems face two important challenges. First, agent behavioral rules are often ad hoc, making it difficult to assess the implications of these models within the larger theoretical context. Second, the lack of relevant empirical data precludes many models from being appropriately initialized and validated, limiting the value of such models for exploring emergent properties or for policy evaluation. To address these issues, in this paper we present a theoretically-based and empirically-driven agent-based model of technology adoption, with an application to residential solar photovoltaic (PV). Using household-level resolution for demographic, attitudinal, social network, and environmental variables, the integrated ABM framework we develop is applied to real-world data covering 2004-2013 for a residential solar PV program at the city scale. Two applications of the model focusing on rebate program design are also presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this article, we take the coordination control problem of linear time-invariant networked systems with uncertain additive disturbance and uncertain initial states into consideration. A distributed interval observer is first constructed for uncertain networked systems in which the control algorithm of each agent involves only the upper bound information and the lower bound information of the interval observer associated with itself and its neighbors, respectively. With the help of the cooperativity theory, it is proved that the interval observer can estimate the piecewise state for each agent and the interval-observer-based control algorithm can drive the uncertain system to achieve coordination behavior. Then, time-varying coordinate transformation is introduced to construct a novel interval observer which can eliminate the cooperativity premise on the system matrices and bound the states of all agents in real time. It is shown that the novel interval-observer-based control algorithm can guide the uncertain system to reach coordinated behavior. Finally, the numerical simulations are provided to verify the theoretical results.

AB Information diffusion and opinion evolution are often treated as two independent processes. Opinion models assume the topic reaches each agent and agents initially have their own ideas. In fact, the processes of information diffusion and opinion evolution often intertwine with each other. Whether the influence between these two processes plays a role in the system state is unclear. In this paper, we collected more than one million real data from a well-known social platform, and analysed large-scale user diffusion behaviour and opinion formation. We found that user inter-event time follows a two-scaling powerlaw distribution with two different power exponents. Public opinion stabilizes quickly and evolves toward the direction of convergence, but the consensus state is prevented by a few opponents. We propose a three-state opinion model accompanied by information diffusion. Agents form and exchange their opinions during information diffusion. Conversely, agents' opinions also influence their diffusion actions. Simulations show that the model with a correlation of the two processes produces similar statistical characteristics as empirical results. A fast epidemic process drives individual opinions to converge more obviously. Unlike previous epidemic models, the number of infected agents does not always increase with the update rate, but has a peak with an intermediate value of the rate.

ID WIRELESS NETWORKS; ALLOCATION; CHANNEL
AB Cooperative communication effectively enhances the channel capacity of wireless networks by allowing some single-antenna nodes to relay data for other nodes. In such a communication scheme, choosing appropriate relay nodes is critical to maximize the overall network performance. In this paper, we consider the assignment problem of relay nodes in a cooperative wireless network, where physical relay infrastructures and relay supporting services (relay assignment) are independently operated by different selfish entities, each of which is driven by its own benefit. We first formulate the problem as a repeated double auction by taking into account the benefits of all entities in the system. That is, we consider a system consisting of a set of source-to-destination pairs, relay nodes, group agents, and the auctioneer, where source nodes are grouped into different groups and each group is represented by a group agent. The source nodes and group agents seek opportunities to maximize their own benefits through untruthful bidding, colluding with each other, and so on. We then show that these behaviors will jeopardize the social benefit of all entities in the system. To mitigate the effect of such behaviors, we devise a truthful repeated double auction that is able to bound the collusion probability of each entity. We finally conduct experiments by simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed auction mechanism. Empirical results show that the proposed auction is effective in collusion-resistance with bounded collusion probabilities. To our best knowledge, this is the first auction mechanism for relay assignment in wireless networks that is truthful, collusion-resistant, budget-balance and individual-rational.

AB Several evolutionary accounts of human social cognition posit that language has co-evolved with the sophisticated mindreading abilities of modern humans. It has also been argued that these mindreading abilities are the product of cultural, rather than biological, evolution. Taken together, these claims suggest that the evolution of language has played an important role in the cultural evolution of human social cognition. Here we present a new computational model which formalises the assumptions that underlie this hypothesis, in order to explore how language and mindreading interact through cultural evolution. This model treats communicative behaviour as an interplay between the context in which communication occurs, an agent's individual perspective on the world, and the agent's lexicon. However, each agent's perspective and lexicon are private mental representations, not directly observable to other agents. Learners are therefore confronted with the task of jointly inferring the lexicon and perspective of their cultural parent, based on their utterances in context. Simulation results show that given these assumptions, an informative lexicon evolves not just under a pressure to be successful at communicating, but also under a pressure for accurate perspective-inference. When such a lexicon evolves, agents become better at inferring others' perspectives; not because their innate ability to learn about perspectives changes, but because sharing a language (of the right type) with others helps them to do so.

AB Region-optimal algorithms are local search algorithms for solving Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs). In each iteration of the search in such algorithms, every agent selects a group of agents that comply with some selection criteria (each algorithm specifies different criteria). Then, the agent who selected the group, called the mediator, collects assignment information from the group and neighboring agents outside the group, in order to find an optimal set of assignments for its group's agents. A contest between mediators of adjacent groups determines which groups will replace their assignments in that iteration to the found optimal ones. In this work we present a framework called RODA (Region Optimal DCOP Algorithm) that encompasses the algorithms in the region optimality family, and in particular any method for selecting groups. We devise a secure implementation of RODA, called P-RODA, which preserves constraint privacy and partial decision privacy. Our discussion covers both symmetric and asymmetric DCOPs. The two main cryptographic means that enable this privacy preservation are secret sharing and homomorphic encryption. We estimate the computational overhead of P-RODA with respect to RODA and give an upper bound that depends on the group and domain sizes and on the graph topology, but not on the number of agents. The estimations are substantiated with experimental results, including experiments on a simulator, that compare the performance of P-RODA to that of its competing algorithm, P-Max-Sum.

AB This paper presents an agent-based model of the standard U.S. k-12th grade classroom using NetLogo. By creating an artificial society, we identify the casual implications of the same-race effect (a moderate sized academic boost to students whose teachers have the same race) on the national educational achievement trends. The model predicts sizeable achievement gaps at the national level, consistent in size with those documented by the US National Report Card (NAEP) stemming from moderate sized same race effects. In addition, matching effects are found to be a source of increased heterogeneity in academic performance for the minority group. These results hold for all teacher-student matching phenomena and have implications for educational policy at the aggregate level. Using artificial societies to disentangle the aggregate effects of hypothesized causes of the achievement gap is a promising strategy that merits further research.

AB In this paper we develop an agent-based marriage model based on social interaction. We build an population of interacting agents whose chances of marrying depend on the availability of partners, and whose willingness to marry depends on the share of relevant others in their social network who are already married. We then let the typical aggregate age pattern of marriage emerge from the bottom-up. The results of our simulation show that micro-level hypotheses founded on existing theory and evidence on social interaction can reproduce age-at-marriage patterns with both realistic shape and realistic micro-level dynamics.

ID EVOLUTION
AB According to Robert Putnam, trust can be a proxy for social capital. Thus, a higher societal trust could be related to economic growth. To test this hypothesis, we simulated the association between trust and economic growth in two artificial societies. One artificial society (New Zealand) exhibited higher levels of initial trust, and the other (Argentina) had lower levels of trust. Initial starting points for simulations were set using representative survey data (using the global trust inventory). Computational simulation relied on a rule-based model (RBM), integrating time through a stochastic simulation algorithm implemented in PISKaS. Agents in the artificial societies were distributed according to proportions of four trust profiles, with more high trusters (HTs) in New Zealand. In each iteration, the agents played a prisoner's dilemma, earning or losing money according to different payoff matrices, cooperation probabilities, and interaction frequencies, modeling different conditions for economic exchange. We analyzed the economic performance of each country, together with the performance of each trust profile. Results support the notion that societies with high trust perform economically better, on average, than those with low trust, but only if interaction frequency is held constant. Despite the relevance of HTs for economic development, their performance is tightly linked to the type of society in which they interact: they prosper more in a Rule of Law society, and where HTs are more common, compared with a predators' paradise, where the sucker's payoff is more punitive.

AB Schelling (1969, 1971a, b, 1978) observed that macro-level patterns do not necessarily reflect micro-level intentions, desires or goals. In his classic model on neighborhood segregation which initiated a large and influential literature, individuals with no desire to be segregated from those who belong to other social groups nevertheless wind up clustering with their own type. Most extensions of Schelling's model have replicated this result. There is an important mismatch, however, between theory and observation, which has received relatively little attention. Whereas Schelling-inspired models typically predict large degrees of segregation starting from virtually any initial condition, the empirical literature documents considerable heterogeneity in measured levels of segregation. This paper introduces a mechanism that can produce significantly higher levels of integration and, therefore, brings predicted distributions of segregation more in line with real-world observation. As in the classic Schelling model, agents in a simulated world want to stay or move to a new location depending on the proportion of neighbors they judge to be acceptable. In contrast to the classic model, agents' classifications of their neighbors as acceptable or not depend lexicographically on recognition first and group type (e. g., ethnic stereotyping) second. The FACE-recognition model nests classic Schelling: When agents have no recognition memory, judgments about the acceptability of a prospective neighbor rely solely on his or her group type (as in the Schelling model). A very small amount of recognition memory, however, eventually leads to different classifications that, in turn, produce dramatic macro-level effects resulting in significantly higher levels of integration. A novel implication of the FACE-recognition model concerns the large potential impact of policy interventions that generate modest numbers of face-to-face encounters with members of other social groups.

AB Nowadays, the booming demand of big data analytics and the constraints of computational ability and network bandwidth have made it difficult for a stand-alone agent/service provider to provide suitable information for every user from the large volume online data within the limited time. To handle this challenge, a recommender system (RS) can call in a group of agents to collaborate to learn users' preference and taste, which is known as a distributed recommender system (DRS). DRSs can improve the accuracy of a traditional RS by requesting agents to share information with each other. However, it is challenging for DRSs to make personalized recommendations for each user due to the large amount of candidates. In addition, information sharing among agents raises a privacy concern. Thus, we propose a privacy-preserving DRS in this paper, and then model each service provider as a distributed online learner with context-awareness. Service providers collaborate to make personalized recommendations by learning users' preferences according to the user context and users' history behaviors. We adopt the federated learning framework to help train a high quality privacy- preserving centralized model over a large number of distributed agents which is probably unreliable with relatively slow network connections. To handle big data scenario, we build an item-cluster tree to deal with online and increasing datasets from top to the bottom. We further consider the structure of social network and present an efficient algorithm to avoid more performance loss adaptively. Theoretical proofs show that our proposed algorithm can achieve sublinear regret and differential privacy protection simultaneously for service providers and users. Numerical results confirm that our novel framework can handle increasing big datasets and strike a trade-off between privacy-preserving level and the prediction accuracy.

AB Some fish species use electric sense to navigate efficiently in the turbid waters of confined spaces. This paper presents a first attempt to use this sense to control a group of nonholonomic rigid underwater vehicles navigating in a cooperative way. A leader whose motion is unknown to the others serves as an active agent for its passive neighbor, which perceives the leader's electric field via current measurements and moves in order to follow a trajectory relative to it. Then, this passive agent, becomes in its turn the leader for the next agent and so on. Sufficient conditions of convergence of the control law are derived for electric current servoing. This is achieved without the explicit knowledge of the location of the agents. Some limits on the possible motion of the leader along with the importance of the choice of controlled outputs are demonstrated. Switching between different group configurations by following a virtual agent is also described. Simulation and experimental results illustrate the theoretical study.

TI Dilemma of Dilemmas: How Collective and Individual Perspectives Can
   Clarify the Size Dilemma in Voluntary Linear Public Goods Dilemmas

LA English
DT Article
ID SOCIAL DILEMMAS; INTEGRATIVE MODEL; PROVISION; RATIONALITY
AB Empirical findings on public goods dilemmas indicate an unresolved dilemma: that increasing size-the number of people in the dilemma-sometimes increases, decreases, or does not influence cooperation. We clarify this dilemma by first classifying public goods dilemma properties that specify individual outcomes as individual properties (e.g., Marginal Per Capita Return) and group outcomes as group properties (e.g., public good multiplier), mathematically showing how only one set of properties can remain constant as the dilemma size increases. Underpinning decision-making regarding individual and group properties, we propose that individuals are motivated by both individual and group preferences based on a theory of collective rationality. We use Van Lange's integrated model of social value orientations to operationalize these preferences as an amalgamation of outcomes for self, outcomes for others, and equality of outcomes. Based on this model, we then predict how the public good's benefit and size, combined with controlling individual versus group properties, produce different levels of cooperation in public goods dilemmas. A two (low vs. high benefit) by three (2-person baseline vs. 5-person holding constant individual properties vs. 5-person holding constant group properties) factorial experiment (group n = 99; participant n = 390) confirms our hypotheses. The results indicate that when holding constant group properties, size decreases cooperation. Yet when holding constant individual properties, size increases cooperation when benefit is low and does not affect cooperation when benefit is high. Using agent-based simulations of individual and group preferences vis-a-vis the integrative model, we fit a weighted simulation model to the empirical data. This fitted model is sufficient to reproduce the empirical results, but only when both individual (self-interest) and group (other-interest and equality) preference are included. Our research contributes to understanding how people's motivations and behaviors within public goods dilemmas interact with the properties of the dilemma to lead to collective outcomes.

AB Population increase and industrialization, particularly in developing countries, has led to the rapid growth of urban areas. To adequately direct urban growth, provide access to urban facilities and preserve the environment, accurate planning is required. As part of urban planning, computer-based simulation models can be used to predict the natural growth of urban areas. The objective of this research is to develop an agent-based simulation model, with different temporal resolutions and reinforced by game theory, to predict the growth of Zanjan city between 2011 and 2016. In the model, three types of land developer, classified according to their income level, are considered as agents, with different attributes and behaviors. Agents search the cellular environment, collect data and select proper sites for development in accordance with their criteria and preferences. When several agents select a single cell for development, their competition is modeled by game theory. The agent-based model is implemented and tested in two scenarios: with game theory and without it. In addition, based on the fact that urban growth is a spatio-temporal phenomenon, different temporal resolutions of 6, 12, 30 and 60 months are considered in the implementation. Kappa statistics, Percent Correct Match, and figure of merit are used to compare the results of modeling scenarios with the urban map of 2016. The best result of 81.1%, 97.32% and 6.38% for Kappa statistics, Percent Correct Match and figure of merit are obtained, when game theory and 6 months resolution is used. The results showed that the usage of game theory and higher temporal resolution have both positive effects on the accuracy of the model. With higher temporal resolutions, the gradual developments of neighboring cells can well be considered by agents. Using game theory can help in modeling the competition-based interactions and behavior of agents.

AB Purpose Social media facilitates consumer exchanges on product opinions and provides comprehensive knowledge of online products. The interaction between consumers and e-retailers evolves into a collective set of dynamics within a complex system. Agent-based modeling is well suited to stimulate such complex systems. The purpose of this paper is to integrate agent-based model and technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) to simulate decision behaviors of e-retailers in competitive online markets.
   Design/methodology/approach An agent-based network model using the TOPSIS driven by actual price data is developed. The authors ran an experimental model to simulate interactions between online consumers and e-retailers and to record simulation data. A nonparametric test is used to conduct data analysis and evaluate the sensibility of parameters.
   Findings Simulation results showed that different profits could be obtained for various brands under different social network structures. E-retailers could achieve more profits through cross-selling than single-selling; however, the highest profits can be achieved when some adopt cross-selling, whereas others use single-selling. From a game perspective, the equilibrium for price-adjustment frequency can be determined from the simulation data. Thus, price adjustment differences significantly affect e-retailer profit.
   Originality/value This study provides new insights into the evolutionary dynamics of online markets. This work also indicates how to build an integrated simulation model with an agent-based model and TOPSIS and how to use an integrated simulation model and interpret its results.

AB Local energy initiatives (LEIs) are communities of households who self-organize to meet their energy demand with locally produced green energy. They facilitate citizen participation by developing context-specific solutions, which calls for leadership and complex social dynamics. We present an agent-based simulation model to explore the formation of community energy initiatives from the bottom-up, accounting for social networks and evolution of opinions facilitating or hindering LEIs. Our novel model relies on well-established social theories and uses empirical data on community energy systems in the Netherlands and individual citizens' preferences. Specifically, our computational model captures behavioural drivers and social value orientations, and relates individuals behavioural traits to aggregated stylized facts about energy initiatives at the community level. The results indicate that when communities lack participants with cooperative orientation, altruistic citizens with prosocial social value orientations become essential for the creation of LEIs, revealing different pathways to achieve public good benefits. Our analysis systematically demonstrate that leaders can be a bottleneck in the LEIs' formation and that an increase in initiators is conducive to the creation of LEIs. Therefore, policies aiming at increasing the number of community initiatives should target small groups and individuals with the leadership potential, who could lead projects, and explore synergies with wider community benefits.

AB We investigate the spatial Public Goods Game in the presence of fitness-driven and conformity-driven agents. This framework usually considers only the former type of agents, i.e., agents that tend to imitate the strategy of their fittest neighbors. However, whenever we study social systems, the evolution of a population might be affected also by social behaviors as conformism, stubbornness, altruism, and selfishness. Although the term evolution can assume different meanings depending on the considered domain, here it corresponds to the set of processes that lead a system towards an equilibrium or a steady state. We map fitness to the agents' payoff so that richer agents are those most imitated by fitness-driven agents, while conformity-driven agents tend to imitate the strategy assumed by the majority of their neighbors. Numerical simulations aim to identify the nature of the transition, on varying the amount of the relative density of conformity-driven agents in the population, and to study the nature of related equilibria. Remarkably, we find that conformism generally fosters ordered cooperative phases and may also lead to bistable behaviors. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2016

AB The hospital system is a complex service system in which patients and hospitals interact and make their decisions based on bounded rationality and information. In this paper, we develop a generative agent-based model to simulate the behavior of a hospital service system. Our model combines agent-based simulation and queueing models to mimic the hospital service processes. Our goal is to simulate and understand the growth and size distribution of hospitals. This simulation model includes agents for supply elements (i.e., hospitals with different resources and expansion strategies) and demand elements (i.e., patients with different preferences for their hospital selections) in a hospital service system. Three important questions are investigated: 1) what is the emergent size distribution of hospitals? 2) what key factors influence the size distribution? and 3) how sensitive is the size distribution to these key factors? Simulation results show that the size distribution is neither power law nor lognormal. Rather, the distribution is leptokurtic, and more skewed than normal but less skewed than lognormal. This result contradicts those in extant literature on the size distributions of human and natural systems, including cities, firms, power-grids, and citation network. We conduct a set of experiments to identify the generative mechanisms for the hospital size distribution and to test the robustness of the results. The model was validated empirically by using a U.S. hospital size dataset.

AB The ability to predict stock returns from financial ratios is a long-standing but still controversial topic. There is ongoing debate about the empirical evidence as well as about appropriate theoretical explanations. We provide evidence from a simulated economy that local, social interaction among agents is remarkably successful in matching several established empirical facts. We find significant return predictability at various forecast horizons, absence of dividend growth predictability, high persistence in dividend yields, and absence of significant return autocorrelations. Our results suggest that social dynamics are a simple, intuitively appealing and successful way to explain predictability.

AB Social networks play an important role in determining the dynamics and outcome of language change. Early empirical studies only examine small-scale local social networks, and focus on the relationship between the individual speakers' linguistic behaviors and their characteristics in the network. In contrast, computer models can provide an efficient tool to consider large-scale networks with different structures and discuss the long-term effect of individuals' learning and interaction on language change. This paper presents an agent-based computer model which simulates language change as a process of innovation diffusion, to address the threshold problem of language change. In the model, the population is implemented as a network of agents with age differences and different learning abilities, and the population is changing, with new agents born periodically to replace old ones. Four typical types of networks and their effect on the diffusion dynamics are examined. When the functional bias is sufficiently high, innovations always diffuse to the whole population in a linear manner in regular and small-world networks, but diffuse quickly in a sharp S-curve in random and scale-free networks. The success rate of diffusion is higher in regular and small-world networks than in random and scale-free networks. In addition, the model shows that as long as the population contains a small number of statistical learners who can learn and use both linguistic variants statistically according to the impact of these variants in the input, there is a very high probability for linguistic innovations with only small functional advantage to overcome the threshold of diffusion.

AB Understanding crowd flow at bottlenecks is important for preventing accidents in emergencies. In this research, a crowd evacuation passing through a narrow exit connected with guide-walls is analysed using the discrete element method based on physical and psychological modelling in parallel with empirical rodent research. Results of rodent experiment and simulation demonstrate the faster-is-slower (FIS) effect, which is a well-known phenomenon in pedestrian dynamics. As the angle of the guide-walls increases, agents rapidly evacuate the room even though they have low velocity. The increase in this angle causes agents to form lanes. It is validated that ordered agents evacuate expeditiously with relatively low velocity despite expectations to the contrary. The extracted experimental and simulation data strongly suggest that the agents' standard deviation of velocity can be a key factor causing the FIS effect. It is found that the FIS effect can be eliminated by controlling the standard deviation.

AB The degree to which prehispanic societies in the northern upland Southwest were hierarchical or egalitarian is still debated and seems likely to have changed through time. This paper examines the plausibility of village-spanning polities in the northern Southwest by simulating the coevolution of hierarchy and warfare using extensions to the Village Ecodynamics Project's agent-based model. We additionally compile empirical data on the population size distribution of habitations and ritual spaces (kivas) and the social groups that used them in three large regions of the Pueblo Southwest and analyze these through time. All lines of evidence refute an "autonomous village" model during the Pueblo II period (A.D. 890-1145); rather, they support the existence of village-spanning polities during the Pueblo II and probably into the Pueblo III period (A.D. 1145-1285) in some areas. One or more polities connecting the northern Southwest, with tribute flowing to an apex in Chaco Canyon, appears plausible during Pueblo II for the areas we examine. During Pueblo III, more local organizations likely held sway until depopulation in the late thirteenth century.

TI Fictional narrative as a variational Bayesian method for estimating
   social dispositions in large groups
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PSYCHOLOGY

AB Modelling intentions in large groups is cognitively costly. Not alone must first order beliefs be tracked ('what does A think about X?'), but also beliefs about beliefs ('what does A think about B's belief concerning X?'). Thus linear increases in group size impose non-linear increases in cognitive processing resources. At the same time, however, large groups offer coordination advantages relative to smaller groups due to specialisation and increased productive capacity. How might these competing demands be reconciled? We propose that fictional narrative can be understood as a cultural tool for dealing with large groups. Specifically, we argue that prototypical action roles that are removed from real-world interactions function as interpretive priors in a form of variational Bayesian inference, such that they allow estimations can be made of unknown social motives. We offer support for this claim in two ways. Firstly, by evaluating the existing literature on narrative cognition and showing where it anticipates a variational model; and secondly, by simulation, where we show that an agent-based model naturally converges on a set of social categories that resemble narrative across a wide range of starting points.

AB Background: The use of conversational agent interventions in mental health is growing at a fast pace. Recent existing reviews have focused exclusively on a subset of embodied conversational agent interventions despite other modalities aiming to achieve the common goal of improved mental health.
   Objective: This study aimed to review the use of conversational agent interventions in the treatment of mental health problems.
   Methods: We performed a systematic search using relevant databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Cochrane library). Studies that reported on an autonomous conversational agent that simulated conversation and reported on a mental health outcome were included.
   Results: A total of 13 studies were included in the review. Among them, 4 full-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. The rest were feasibility, pilot RCTs and quasi-experimental studies. Interventions were diverse in design and targeted a range of mental health problems using a wide variety of therapeutic orientations. All included studies reported reductions in psychological distress postintervention. Furthermore, 5 controlled studies demonstrated significant reductions in psychological distress compared with inactive control groups. In addition, 3 controlled studies comparing interventions with active control groups failed to demonstrate superior effects. Broader utility in promoting well-being in nonclinical populations was unclear.
   Conclusions: The efficacy and acceptability of conversational agent interventions for mental health problems are promising. However, a more robust experimental design is required to demonstrate efficacy and efficiency. A focus on streamlining interventions, demonstrating equivalence to other treatment modalities, and elucidating mechanisms of action has the potential to increase acceptance by users and clinicians and maximize reach.

AB Collective behavior emerges from interactions among group members who often vary in their behavior. The presence of just one or a few keystone individuals, such as leaders or tutors, may have a large effect on collective outcomes. These individuals can catalyze behavioral changes in other group members, thus altering group composition and collective behavior. The influence of keystone individuals on group function may lead to trade-offs between ecological situations, because the behavioral composition they facilitate may be suitable in one situation but not another. We use computer simulations to examine various mechanisms that allow keystone individuals to exert their influence on group members. We further discuss a trade-off between two potentially conflicting collective outcomes, cooperative prey attack and disease dynamics. Our simulations match empirical data from a social spider system and produce testable predictions for the causes and consequences of the influence of keystone individuals on group composition and collective outcomes. We find that a group's behavioral composition can be impacted by the keystone individual through changes to interaction patterns or behavioral persistence over time. Group behavioral composition and the mechanisms that drive the distribution of phenotypes influence collective outcomes and lead to trade-offs between disease dynamics and cooperative prey attack.

AB Accurate localization of road agents (GNSS receivers) is the basis of intelligent transportation systems, which is still difficult to achieve for GNSS positioning in urban areas due to the signal interferences from buildings. Various collaborative positioning techniques were recently developed to improve the positioning performance by the aid from neighboring agents. However, it is still challenging to study their performances comprehensively. The GNSS measurement error behavior is complicated in urban areas and unable to be represented by naive models. On the other hand, real experiments requiring numbers of devices are difficult to conduct, especially for a large-scale test. Therefore, a GNSS realistic urban measurement simulator is developed to provide measurements for collaborative positioning studies. The proposed simulator employs a ray-tracing technique searching for all possible interferences in the urban area. Then, it categorizes them into direct, reflected, diffracted, and multipath signal to simulate the pseudorange, C/N0, and Doppler shift measurements correspondingly. The performance of the proposed simulator is validated through real experimental comparisons with different scenarios based on commercial-grade receivers. The proposed simulator is also applied with different positioning algorithms, which verifies it is sophisticated enough for the collaborative positioning studies in the urban area.

AB This study introduces semantic network analysis of natural language processing in collective social settings. It utilizes the spreading-activation theory of human long-term memories from social psychology to extract information and graph-theoretic linguistic approximations supporting rational propositional inference and formalisms. Using an empirical case study we demonstrate the process of extracting linguistic concepts from data and training a Hopfield artificial neural network for semantic network classification. We further develop an agent-based computational model of network evolution in order to study the processes and patterns of collective semantic knowledge representation, introducing incidents of collapses in central network structures. Large ensembles of simulation replication experiments are conducted and the resulted networks are analyzed using a variety of estimation techniques. We show how collective social structure emerges from simple interactions among semantic categories. Our findings provide evidence of the significance of collapse and reorganization effects in the structure of collective social knowledge; the statistical importance of the within-factor interactions in network evolution, and; stochastic exploration of whole parameter spaces in large ensembles of simulation runs can reveal important self-organizing aspects of the system's behavior. The last session discusses the results and revisits the issues of generative semantic inference and the semantic networks as inferential formalisms in guiding self-organizing systemic complexity.

DT Article
DE Ad hoc teamwork; Multiagent systems; Multiagent cooperation;
   Reinforcement learning; Pursuit domain; RoboCup soccer
AB Robots are being deployed in an increasing variety of environments for longer periods of time. As the number of robots grows, they will increasingly need to interact with other robots. Additionally, the number of companies and research laboratories producing these robots is increasing, leading to the situation where these robots may not share a common communication or coordination protocol. While standards for coordination and communication may be created, we expect that robots will need to additionally reason intelligently about their teammates with limited information. This problem motivates the area of ad hoc teamwork in which an agent may potentially cooperate with a variety of teammates in order to achieve a shared goal. This article focuses on a limited version of the ad hoc teamwork problem in which an agent knows the environmental dynamics and has had past experiences with other teammates, though these experiences may not be representative of the current teammates. To tackle this problem, this article introduces a new general-purpose algorithm, PLASTIC, that reuses knowledge learned from previous teammates or provided by experts to quickly adapt to new teammates. This algorithm is instantiated in two forms: 1) PLASTIC-Model - which builds models of previous teammates' behaviors and plans behaviors online using these models and 2) PLASTIC-Policy - which learns policies for cooperating with previous teammates and selects among these policies online. We evaluate PLASTIC on two benchmark tasks: the pursuit domain and robot soccer in the RoboCup 2D simulation domain. Recognizing that a key requirement of ad hoc teamwork is adaptability to previously unseen agents, the tests use more than 40 previously unknown teams on the first task and 7 previously unknown teams on the second. While PLASTIC assumes that there is some degree of similarity between the current and past teammates' behaviors, no steps are taken in the experimental setup to make sure this assumption holds. The teammates were created by a variety of independent developers and were not designed to share any similarities. Nonetheless, the results show that PLASTIC was able to identify and exploit similarities between its current and past teammates' behaviors, allowing it to quickly adapt to new teammates.

TI Information-theoretic models of deception: Modelling cooperation and
   diffusion in populations exposed to "fake news"
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID RUMOR SPREADING MODEL; ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKS; HYPERGAMES; EVOLUTION
AB The modelling of deceptions in game theory and decision theory has not been well studied, despite the increasing importance of this problem in social media, public discourse, and organisational management. This paper presents an improved formulation of the extant information-theoretic models of deceptions, a framework for incorporating these models of deception into game and decision theoretic models of deception, and applies these models and this framework in an agent based evolutionary simulation that models two very common deception types employed in "fake news" attacks. The simulation results for both deception types modelled show, as observed empirically in many social systems subjected to "fake news" attacks, that even a very small population of deceivers that transiently invades a much larger population of non-deceiving agents can strongly alter the equilibrium behaviour of the population in favour of agents playing an always defect strategy. The results also show that the ability of a population of deceivers to establish itself or remain present in a population is highly sensitive to the cost of the deception, as this cost reduces the fitness of deceiving agents when competing against non-deceiving agents. Diffusion behaviours observed for agents exploiting the deception producing false beliefs are very close to empirically observed behaviours in social media, when fitted to epidemiological models. We thus demonstrate, using the improved formulation of the information-theoretic models of deception, that agent based evolutionary simulations employing the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma can accurately capture the behaviours of a population subject to deception attacks introducing uncertainty and false perceptions, and show that information-theoretic models of deception have practical applications beyond trivial taxonomical analysis.

AB In this paper, we propose a novel approach to exploring the destimgatisation process, an agent-based model called the destigmatization model (DSIM). In the DSIM, we demonstrate that, even if individual interactions (intergroup contact) are based on rules of the self-fulfilling prophecy, it can lead to destigmatisation. In a second study, we empirically verify a prediction that there is a positive relationship between minority group size and perceived stigmatization. Finally, we confirm that DSIM successfully implements Allport's (1954) four moderators, in turn decreasing the level of perceived stigma of the minority group. Interestingly, however, some of Allport's moderators influence the speed of destigmatisation, rather than having a lasting impact on the process of prejudice reduction. The findings suggest that moderators of 'intergroup contact' can function in one of two ways, either by improving how much contact helps to reduce stigmatization or by improving how quickly destigmatization can occur.

AB It is generally assumed that high-resolution movement data are needed to extract meaningful decision-making patterns of animals on the move. Here we propose a modified version of force matching (referred to here as direction matching), whereby sparse movement data (i.e., collected over minutes instead of seconds) can be used to test hypothesized forces acting on a focal animal based on their ability to explain observed movement. We first test the direction matching approach using simulated data from an agent-based model, and then go on to apply it to a sparse movement data set collected on a troop of baboons in the DeHoop Nature Reserve, South Africa. We use the baboon data set to test the hypothesis that an individual's motion is influenced by the group as a whole or, alternatively, whether it is influenced by the location of specific individuals within the group. Our data provide support for both hypotheses, with stronger support for the latter. The focal animal showed consistent patterns of movement toward particular individuals when distance from these individuals increased beyond 5.6 m. Although the focal animal was also sensitive to the group movement on those occasions when the group as a whole was highly clustered, these conditions of isolation occurred infrequently. We suggest that specific social interactions may thus drive overall group cohesion. The results of the direction matching approach suggest that relatively sparse data, with low technical and economic costs, can be used to test between hypotheses on the factors driving movement decisions.

ID DISTRIBUTED FORMATION CONTROL; CONSENSUS; SYSTEMS
AB This paper introduces the notion of weak rigidity to characterize a framework by pairwise inner products of interagent displacements. Compared to distance-based rigidity, weak rigidity requires fewer constrained edges in the graph to determine a geometric shape in an arbitrarily dimensional space. A necessary and sufficient graphical condition for infinitesimal weak rigidity of planar frameworks is derived. As an application of the proposed weak rigidity theory, a gradient-based control law and a nongradient-based control law are designed for a group of single-integrator modeled agents to stabilize a desired formation shape, respectively. Using the gradient control law, we prove that an infinitesimally weakly rigid formation is locally exponentially stable. In particular, if the number of agents is one greater than the dimension of the space, a minimally infinitesimally weakly rigid formation is almost globally asymptotically stable. In the literature of rigid formation, the sensing graph is always required to be rigid. Using the nongradient control law based on weak rigidity theory, it is not necessary for the sensing graph to be rigid for local exponential stability of the formation. A numerical simulation is performed for illustrating the effectiveness of our main results.

AB many people, home is a sanctuary. For those people who need special medical care, they may need to be pulled out of their home to meet their medical needs. As the population ages, the percentage of people in this group is increasing and the effects are expensive as well as unsatisfying. We hypothesize that many people with disabilities can lead independent lives in their own homes with the aid of at-home automated assistance and health monitoring. In order to accomplish this, robust methods must be developed to collect relevant data and process it dynamically and adaptively to detect and/or predict threatening long-term trends or immediate crises. The main objective of this paper is to investigate techniques for using agent-based smart home technologies to provide this at-home health monitoring and assistance. To this end, we have developed novel inhabitant modeling and automation algorithms that provide remote health monitoring for caregivers. Specifically, we address the following technological challenges: 1) identifying lifestyle trends, 2) detecting anomalies in current data, and 3) designing a reminder assistance system. Our solution approaches are being tested in simulation and with volunteers at the UTA's MavHome site, an agent-based smart home project.

AB As a relatively new collaborative service mode, Mobile Instant Messaging (MIM) is gaining ever greater popularity. MIM users interact within a complex system to influence others' adoption decisions, thus resulting in behavioral evolution. An agent-based computational approach is a methodology well suited to the simulation of this complex system. In this study, we build an agent-based computational model driven by empirical data. The model can present the evolution of the adoption of MIM. We also conduct simulation experiments to examine how some social and economic factors affect the behavioral evolution of the adoption of MIM. The results indicate that the average degree of nodes in a network has a significant effect on behavioral evolution in comparison with brand intensity. In contrast to the perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and perceived entertainment value, the perceived cost and inter-operability has a lesser degree of influence on the adoption behavior. The different compositions of various groups have significantly different effects on the evolution of MIM adoption behavior.

AB An agent based model for assessing the welfare impacts of urban disasters is presented. This couples a population allocation algorithm with a simulation platform. The fully articulated model fuses both bottom-up (locational choice for workplace, residence and daily activities) and top-down (land use and housing price) protocols. This study moves beyond current research by addressing economic welfare consequences of urban disasters. The resilience capabilities of different income groups are identified. This is illustrated for the Jerusalem central business district. Empirical results at the micro-scale suggest that physical destruction leads to a zero-sum game within the housing market in which wealthier residents hold an advantage over the poor. This results in the transformation of neighborhoods and displacement of poor and vulnerable populations. Low income groups lose both physical ground and the social support systems that go with location. Policy implications of these findings are discussed. (C)2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Metapolybia wasps live in small societies (around one hundred adults) and rear their young in nests they construct on flat surfaces from plant materials. For processing nest paper, they must gather plant materials and process it into pulp with water. The water is collected by water foragers and is transferred to pulp foragers indirectly via a "common stomach." The common stomach, or social crop, is formed by generalist wasps called laborers. These wasps can engage in water exchange, store water in their crops, and may become specialist foragers or builders. We provide an alternative model for regulating task partitioning in construction behavior by using an agent based modeling framework parameterized by our field observations. Our model predicts that assessing colony needs via individual interactions with the common stomach leads to a robust regulation of task partitioning in construction behavior. By using perturbation experiments in our simulations, we show that this emergent task allocation is able to dynamically adapt to perturbations of the environment and to changes in colony-level demands or population structure. The robustness of our model stems from the fact that the common stomach is both a strong buffer and a source of several feedback mechanisms that affect the individual wasps. We show that both the efficiency and the task fidelity of these colonies are dependent upon colony size. We also demonstrate that the emergence of specialist wasps (individuals with high task fidelity) does not require any special initial conditions or reinforcement at the individual level, but it is rather a consequence of colony-level workflow stability. Our model closely mimics the behavior of Metapolybia wasps, demonstrating that a regulation mechanism based on simple pair-wise interactions through a common stomach is a plausible hypothesis for the organization of collective behavior.

AB Travel mode choices are a result of several factors and how they affect individual travellers. This paper examines those factors influencing travellers' mode choices commuting to and from a university. Furthermore, we investigate how a shift to alternative modes can be stimulated within the current transport system environment of that university. From focus groups studies, seven measurable themes were identified as metrics for travellers' satisfaction. Descriptive data has been collected from 348 participants through questionnaires. The analysis of the questionnaires provided insights into the development of appropriate policies to stimulate travellers' mode shift. To allow for studying the impact of applying proposed interventions over time, we simulated the effects of those interventions on travellers' mode choice by using an agent-based social simulation approach. We employed a framework designed for modelling modal shift in the transport domain to build the simulation model, taking the themes into consideration. The outcomes of the study assisted in understanding how decision factors and their interconnections contribute to sub-populations of travellers' choice. In addition, our experiments helped in assessing the importance of interactions among travellers on their decision making. Such an understanding provides insight into those factors within the system that need to be considered when policymakers develop strategies for interventions for mode shift. The outcomes of the simulation experiments indicate that different policy interventions result in distinct travellers' mode adoption patterns and that interventions perform better when the right categories or groups of travellers are targeted. In addition, the intervention should focus on the right travellers' concerns and be applied in the right proportion. This social simulation study has also demonstrated how a theory-based framework can be used with survey data in numerical experiments to explore real-life scenarios for the development of actions to promote behavioural changes.

AB We focus on the "trijunction" between multiscale computations, bifurcation theory and social networks. In particular, we address how the Equation-Free approach, a recently developed computational framework, can be exploited to systematically extract coarse-grained, emergent dynamical information by bridging detailed, agent-based models of social interactions on networks, with macroscopic, systems-level, continuum numerical analysis tools. For our illustrations, we use a simple dynamic agent-based model describing the propagation of information between individuals interacting under mimesis in a social network with private and public information. We describe the rules governing the evolution of the agents' emotional state dynamics and discover, through simulation, multiple stable stationary states as a function of the network topology. Using the Equation-Free approach we track the dependence of these stationary solutions on network parameters and quantify their stability in the form of coarse-grained bifurcation diagrams.

AB In reality, social diversity is omnipresent. Motivated by the fact that different agents may get different perceptions for the same social dilemma, we extended the concept of heterogeneous perceptions to dynamically varying network and investigate the impact on the evolution of cooperation in this paper. Here, the heterogeneous perceptions of different agents are modeling by spatial multigames, which are characterized by two different social dilemmas: the traditional prisoners' dilemma and the snowdrift game. The dynamic network, on the other hands, is a network whose link weights are coevolved with game strategy. By conducting large-scale Monte Carlo simulations, we draw a conclusion that for small temptation a large value of network evolution strength warrants an optimal resolution of social dilemma; while for large temptation an intermediate value of network evolution strength is the most beneficial for the evolution of cooperation. In addition, numerical simulations also indicate that the higher the value of the proportion of the snowdrift game is, the more widespread cooperative behavior becomes except for some small fluctuations. Taken together, our results support that the agents with heterogeneous perceptions in dynamic network are strong facilitators of cooperation promotion, which will provide a new insight for the further research.

ID DECISION-MAKING; GAME-THEORY; BEHAVIOR; CORTEX; REPRESENTATION;
   PREDICTION
AB Understanding the principles by which agents interact with both complex environments and each other is a key goal of decision neuroscience. However, most previous studies have used experimental paradigms in which choices are discrete (and few), play is static, and optimal solutions are known. Yet in natural environments, interactions between agents typically involve continuous action spaces, ongoing dynamics, and no known optimal solution. Here, we seek to bridge this divide by using a penalty shot task in which pairs of monkeys competed against each other in a competitive, real-time video game. We modeled monkeys' strategies as driven by stochastically evolving goals, onscreen positions that served as set points for a control model that produced observed joystick movements. We fit this goal-based dynamical system model using approximate Bayesian inference methods, using neural networks to parameterize players' goals as a dynamic mixture of Gaussian components. Our model is conceptually simple, constructed of interpretable components, and capable of generating synthetic data that capture the complexity of real player dynamics. We further characterized players' strategies using the number of change points on each trial. We found that this complexity varied more across sessions than within sessions, and that more complex strategies benefited offensive players but not defensive players. Together, our experimental paradigm and model offer a powerful combination of tools for the study of realistic social dynamics in the laboratory setting.
   Author summary Most studies of strategic decision making make use of simple tasks in which agents choose among only a limited number of distinct options. But real-world behavior is complex, requiring ongoing adjustment of strategies. Here, we propose a new model that is capable of reproducing the rich behavior of monkeys playing against each other in a dynamic decision task. Our model quantifies players' goals at each moment and offers a means of performing controlled experiments via simulation. This makes possible more realistic experimental paradigms for the study of strategic decision making and social interaction.

AB This paper presents a heterogeneous agent network model as a simple representation to simultaneously characterize the time-invariant and time-varying topologies of various networked systems in communication and social networks, where two types of nodes: mobile agents, abstracted as random walkers in plane, and fixed agents interact with each other according to the neighborhood rule. The analytical results show that the mobile agent density determines synchronization of the considered heterogeneous network under the fast-switching constraint. In particular, a global synchronization behavior appears by introducing a proper mobile agent density. Numerical experiments verify the theoretical results above acquired.

DE Self-governance; Norms; Prison; Agent-based model
AB How do norms evolve when people have no choice to opt out of social interactions? One example of such a setting is prison. Past research usually relies on ethnographic work to understand the emergence and maintenance of norms among prisoners. We instead use this rich qualitative literature to inform an agent-based model to demonstrate how norms evolve in response to demographic changes in prison. In the model, agents play a one-shot, though possibly repeated, prisoner's dilemma with other agents. Agents lack the ability to decline to play with their selected opponent. We consider tag-mediated play and norm enforcement as mechanisms to facilitate prisoner cooperation and to examine the effects of increasing prison populations and increasing ethnic heterogeneity on the maintenance of cooperative norms. We also calibrate the model with empirical data from the California prison system. Parameters of the model correspond to demographic changes between 1951 and 2016, where the size of the prison population increased 14-fold and ethnic heterogeneity by 30%. Simulation results show that such changes dramatically decrease levels of cooperation and compliance. These results are consistent with the actual observed breakdown of the cooperative norms in California prisons.

ID PRISONERS-DILEMMA; COOPERATION; EVOLUTION; EMERGENCE
AB The effect of group structure on cooperative behavior is not well understood. In this paper, we study the dynamics of a public goods game involving n-agent interactions. In the proposed setup, the population is organized into groups. We associate the individual fitness to group performance, while the evolutionary dynamics takes place globally. We derive analytical expressions and show that the model exhibits several fixed points, including the symmetric homogeneous states of total cooperation and total defection, which are unstable and stable, respectively. Interestingly, even if both individual and group levels are organized as well-mixed populations, the dynamics displays intermediate values of cooperation under the replicator dynamics. Namely, as soon as one of the groups, at least, is fully cooperative, intermediary fixed points appear for the rest of the groups. In addition to the analytical approach, we have performed numerical simulations that reproduce the internal fixed points obtained theoretically, showing coexisting intermediate levels of cooperation. Potential implications of these results in terms of group selection and the role of social norms are also discussed.

AB Uncontrolled bleeding remains the leading cause of preventable death in trauma. Hemostatic agents are effective in hemorrhage control but often fail following high-volume crystalloid resuscitation. Aggressive fluid resuscitation increases the blood pressure which may dislodge the newly formed clot causing rebleeding. The purpose of this study was to determine the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the mean arterial pressure (MAP) at which rebleeding occurs when a clot is formed by one of these hemostatic agents (Bleed Arrest, TraumaDex, or Celox) compared to a control group. This was a prospective, experimental study using male 5 Yorkshire swine per group (Bleed Arrest, TraumaDex, Celox, or control). The femoral artery and vein were transected to simulate a traumatic injury. Subjects were allowed to bleed for 60 seconds then one of the agents was poured into the wound. The control group underwent the same procedures but without the hemostatic agent. After 30 minutes, dressings were removed and the SBP was increased incrementally using intravenous phenylephrine until rebleeding occurred or until the arterial blood pressure reached 210 mm/Hg. The SBP and MAP were significantly higher in the Bleed Arrest, Trauma Dex, and Celox groups compared to a control group (p < 0.05).

ID DYNAMICS; MODEL
AB Social groups of interacting agents display an ability to coordinate in the absence of a central authority, a phenomenon that has been recently amplified by the widespread availability of social networking technologies. Models of opinion formation in a population of agents have proven a very useful tool to investigate these phenomena that arise independently of the heterogeneities across individuals and can be used to identify the factors that determine whether widespread consensus on an initial small majority is reached. Recently, we introduced a model in which individual agents can have conservative and partisan biases. Numerical simulations for finite populations showed that while the inclusion of conservative agents in a population enhances the population's efficiency in reaching consensus on the initial majority opinion, even a small fraction of partisans leads the population to converge on the opinion initially held by a minority. To further understand the mechanisms leading to our previous numerical results, we investigate analytically the noise driven transition from a regime in which the population reaches a majority consensus (efficient), to a regime in which the population settles in deadlock (non-efficient). We show that the mean-field solution captures what we observe in model simulations. Populations of agents with no opinion bias show a continuous transition to a deadlock regime, while populations with an opinion bias, show a discontinuous transition between efficient and partisan regimes. Furthermore, the analytical solution reveals that populations with an increasing fraction of conservative agents are more robust against noise than a population of naive agents because in the efficient regime there are relatively more conservative than naive agents holding the majority opinion. In contrast, populations with partisan agents are less robust to noise with an increasing fraction of partisans, because in the efficient regime there are relatively more naive agents than partisan agents holding the majority opinion.

The consensus evolution behavior is studied under general consensus protocol when each node is disturbed by the relative states between the node and its neighbors. At first, the robust consensus condition is obtained and the convergency analysis is given by using Lyapunov stability theory and matrix theory. Then, the practical consensus is investigated and the bound of the error states is presented. Finally, two numerical simulation examples are given to illustrate the proposed theoretical results.

AB In this study we describe a simulation platform used to create a virtual society of Poland, with a particular emphasis on contact patterns arising from daily commuting to schools or workplaces. In order to reproduce the map of contacts, we are using a geo-referenced Agent Based Model. Within this framework, we propose a set of different stochastic algorithms, utilizing available aggregated census data. Based on this model system, we present selected statistical analysis, such as the accessibility of schools or the location of rescue service units. This platform will serve as a base for further large scale epidemiological and transportation simulation studies. However, the first approach to a simple, country-wide transportation model is also presented here. The application scope of the platform extends beyond the simulations of epidemic or transportation, and pertains to any situation where there are no easily available means, other than computer simulations, to conduct large scale investigations of complex population dynamics.

AB In this paper, a new class of two-layer event-triggered sliding-mode control (TLETSMC) is proposed for finite-time robust consensus of nonlinear disturbed multiagent systems. Under the proposed TLETSMC, the states of nonlinear disturbed multiagent systems reach the designed sliding-mode surface in finite time, and then stay on it, where the finite-time consensus is also guaranteed. Additionally, within the sliding motion, the external disturbances are rejected and the Zeno behavior is excluded. The advantages of the presented TLETSMC are twofold. First, it can provide finite-time convergence performance for the presented robust consensus problem. Second, the algorithm complexity of the TLETSMC is identical to that of traditional one-layer event-triggered sliding-mode control (OLETSMC). To further illustrate the above two advantages, three other trigger control algorithms are presented. The corresponding comparison studies among the aforementioned trigger control algorithms are carried out by introducing a new performance index named trigger rate, which refers to the proportion of the trigger number under the unit sampled-date number and the smaller the better. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the theoretical results. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Retail self-service checkouts (SCOs) can benefit consumers and retailers, providing control and autonomy to shoppers independent from staff. Recent research indicates that the lack of presence of staff may provide the opportunity for consumers to behave dishonestly. This study examined whether a social presence in the form of visual, humanlike SCO interface agents had an effect on dishonest user behaviour. Using a simulated SCO scenario, participants experienced various dilemmas in which they could financially benefit themselves undeservedly. We hypothesized that a humanlike social presence integrated within the checkout screen would receive more attention and result in fewer instances of dishonesty compared to a less humanlike agent. Our hypotheses were partially supported by the results. We conclude that companies adopting self-service technology may consider the implementation of social presence to support ethical consumer behaviour, but that more research is required to explore the mixed findings in the current study.
   RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS
   A method by Vohs and Schooler (2008) was adapted for investigating dishonesty.
   Social presence is proposed as a mediator for dishonest behaviour.
   There is scope for social presence to influence user behaviour in a world that increasingly relies on self-service transactions.
   The effectiveness of measures of dishonesty needs to be researched further.

AB We review agent-based models (ABM) of human migration with respect to their decision-making rules. The most prominent behavioural theories used as decision rules are the random utility theory, as implemented in the discrete choice model, and the theory of planned behaviour. We identify the critical choices that must be made in developing an ABM, namely the modelling of decision processes and social networks. We also discuss two challenges that hamper the widespread use of ABM in the study of migration and, more broadly, demography and the social sciences: (a) the choice and the operationalisation of a behavioural theory (decision-making and social interaction) and (b) the selection of empirical evidence to validate the model. We offer advice on how these challenges might be overcome.

TI Opinion formation on social media: An empirical approach
SO CHAOS
LA English
DT Article
ID STATISTICAL PHYSICS; MODEL; DYNAMICS; BEHAVIOR
AB Opinion exchange models aim to describe the process of public opinion formation, seeking to uncover the intrinsic mechanism in social systems; however, the model results are seldom empirically justified using large-scale actual data. Online social media provide an abundance of data on opinion interaction, but the question of whether opinion models are suitable for characterizing opinion formation on social media still requires exploration. We collect a large amount of user interaction information from an actual social network, i.e.,Twitter, and analyze the dynamic sentiments of users about different topics to investigate realistic opinion evolution. We find two nontrivial results from these data. First, public opinion often evolves to an ordered state in which one opinion predominates, but not to complete consensus. Second, agents are reluctant to change their opinions, and the distribution of the number of individual opinion changes follows a power law. Then, we suggest a model in which agents take external actions to express their internal opinions according to their activity. Conversely, individual actions can influence the activity and opinions of neighbors. The probability that an agent changes its opinion depends nonlinearly on the fraction of opponents who have taken an action. Simulation results show user action patterns and the evolution of public opinion in the model coincide with the empirical data. For different nonlinear parameters, the system may approach different regimes. A large decay in individual activity slows down the dynamics, but causes more ordering in the system.

AB There is an increasing drive to combine agent-based models with empirical methods. An overview is provided of the various empirical methods that are used for different kinds of questions. Four categories of empirical approaches are identified in which agent-based models have been empirically tested: case studies, stylized facts, role-playing games, and laboratory experiments. We discuss how these different types of empirical studies can be combined. The various ways empirical techniques are used illustrate the main challenges of contemporary social sciences: (1) how to develop models that are generalizable and still applicable in specific cases, and (2) how to scale up the processes of interactions of a few agents to interactions among many agents.

DT Article
AB Motivation: Cyclodextrins (CDs) are amongst the most versatile/multi-functional molecules used in molecular research and chemical applications. They are natural cyclic oligosaccharides typically employed to encapsulate hydrophobic groups in their central cavity. This allows solubilizing, protecting or reducing the toxicity of a large variety of different molecules including drugs, dyes and surfactant agents. In spite of their great potential, atomic level information of these molecules, which is key for their function, is really scarce. Computational Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations have the potential to efficiently fill this gap, providing structural-dynamic information at atomic level in time scales ranging from ps to mu s.
   Results: Cyclo-lib is a database with a publicly accessible web-interface containing structural and dynamic analysis obtained from computational MD simulation trajectories (250 ns long) of native and modified CDs in explicit water molecules. Cyclo-lib currently includes 70 CDs typically employed for fundamental and industrial research. Tools for comparative analysis between different CDs, as well as to restrict the analysis to specific time-segments within the trajectories are also available. Cyclo-lib provides atomic resolution information aimed to complement experimental results performed with the same molecules.
   Availability and Implementation: The database is freely available under http://cyclo-lib.mduse.com/.

AB Security has become one of the major concerns in mobile adhoc networks (MANETs). Data and voice communication amongst roaming battlefield entities (such as platoon of soldiers, inter-battlefield tanks and military aircrafts) served by MANETs throw several challenges. It requires complex securing strategy to address threats such as unauthorized network access, man in the middle attacks, denial of service etc., to provide highly reliable communication amongst the nodes. Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) undoubtedly is a crucial ingredient to address these threats. IDPS in MANET is managed by Command Control Communication and Intelligence (C3I) system. It consists of networked computers in the tactical battle area that facilitates comprehensive situation awareness by the commanders for timely and optimum decision-making. Key issue in such IDPS mechanism is lack of Smart Learning Engine. We propose a novel behavioral based "Smart Multi-Instance Multi-Label Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (MIML-IDPS)" that follows a distributed and centralized architecture to support a Robust C3I System. This protocol is deployed in a virtually clustered non-uniform network topology with dynamic election of several virtual head nodes acting as a client Intrusion Detection agent connected to a centralized server IDPS located at Command and Control Center. Distributed virtual client nodes serve as the intelligent decision processing unit and centralized IDPS server act as a Smart MIML decision making unit. Simulation and experimental analysis shows the proposed protocol exhibits computational intelligence with counter attacks, efficient memory utilization, classification accuracy and decision convergence in securing C3I System in a Tactical Battlefield environment.

AB Alliance networks are the underlying structures of social systems in business, management, and society. The sustainability and dynamics of a social system rely on the structural evolutions of the topologies. Understanding the evolution sheds light on the dynamics and sustainability of a social system. Minority game models have been successfully applied across social science, economy, management, and engineering. They provide simple yet applicable modeling to articulate the evolutionary cooperation dynamics of competitive players in binary decision situations. By extending the minority games played in alliance networks, the cooperation in structured systems of different network topologies is analyzed. In this model, local and global score strategies are considered with and without cooperation rewiring options. The cooperation level, the score, and the topological properties are investigated. The research uses a numerical simulation approach on random networks, scale-free networks, and small-world networks. The results suggest that the network rewiring strategy leads to higher systemic performance with a higher score and a higher level of stability in decision-making. Competitive decision-making can lead to a higher level of cooperation from a poor initial start. However, stubbornness in decision-making can lead to a poor situation when cooperation is discouraged. Players with local or global information adopt local and global score strategies. The results show that local strategies might lead to imbalance, while a global strategy might achieve a relatively stable outcome. This work contributes to bridge minority games in structured networks to study the cooperation between formation and evolution, and calls for future minority game modeling on social networks.

AB Moral norms are fundamental for virtually all social interactions, including cooperation. Moral norms develop and change, but the mechanisms underlying when, and how, such changes occur are not well-described by theories of moral psychology. We tested, and confirmed, the hypothesis that the commonness of an observed behavior consistently influences its moral status, which we refer to as the common is moral (CIM) heuristic. In 9 experiments, we used an experimental model of dynamic social interaction that manipulated the commonness of altruistic and selfish behaviors to examine the change of peoples' moral judgments. We found that both altruistic and selfish behaviors were judged as more moral, and less deserving of punishment, when common than when rare, which could be explained by a classical formal model (social impact theory) of behavioral conformity. Furthermore, judgments of common versus rare behaviors were faster, indicating that they were computationally more efficient. Finally, we used agent-based computer simulations to investigate the endogenous population dynamics predicted to emerge if individuals use the CIM heuristic, and found that the CIM heuristic is sufficient for producing 2 hallmarks of real moral norms; stability and sudden changes. Our results demonstrate that commonness shapes our moral psychology through mechanisms similar to behavioral conformity with wide implications for understanding the stability and change of moral norms.

AB In recent years, serious fire and explosion accident in petrochemical storage tanks have taken place frequently. Therefore, increasing the firefighting force in petrochemical parks is particularly important. The ambition of the paper is mainly studying the supply intensity of Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) extinguishing agent. Fire extinguishing agent demand calculation method that can be capable of matching fire scale is established by carrying out series of fire extinguishing experiments. 6% AFFF is chosen to carry out three groups of experiments respectively: fire extinguishing agent fluidity determination, series groups of small size simulation oil pool fire and 177 square meters of large oil pool fire extinguishing experiment. The situation of fire extinguishing on fuel surface of AFFF can be explored through experimental means under cold and hot conditions. The data obtained from experiments prove a higher conformity between covering process and covering model under the cold condition. The model can predict the cold coverage of AFFF effectively. After unifying the supply flow from each experiment, the statistics can be fitted and come to the minimum supply intensity algorithm of AFFF against the target storage tank specifications. The algorithm is used to estimate the minimum supply intensity when extinguishing full liquid surface fire. This model also can be used as reference for petrochemical fire protection.

AB Implicit social biases play a critical role in shaping our attitudes towards other people. Such biases are thought to arise, in part, from a comparison between features of one's own self-image and those of another agent, a process known as 'bodily resonance'. Recent data have demonstrated that implicit bias can be remarkably plastic, being modulated by brief immersive virtual reality experiences that place participants in a virtual body with features of an out-group member. Here, we provide a mechanistic account of bodily resonance and implicit bias in terms of a putative self-image network that encodes associations between different features of an agent. When subsequently perceiving another agent, the output of this self-image network is proportional to the overlap between their respective features, providing an index of bodily resonance. By combining the self-image network with a drift diffusion model of decision making, we simulate performance on the implicit association test (LAT) and show that the model captures the ubiquitous implicit bias towards in-group members. We subsequently demonstrate that this implicit bias can be modulated by a simulated illusory body ownership experience, consistent with empirical data; and that the magnitude and plasticity of implicit bias correlates with self-esteem. Hence, we provide a simple mechanistic account of bodily resonance and implicit bias which could contribute to the development of interventions for reducing the negative evaluation of social out-groups.

AB Increasing ethnic diversity fosters scholarly interest in how the spatial segregation of groups affects opinion polarization in a society. Despite much empirical and theoretical research, there is little consensus in the literature on the causal link between the spatial segregation of two groups and the emergence of opinion polarization. We contribute to the debate by investigating theoretically the conditions under which the former fosters or hinders the latter. We focus on two processes of opinion polarization ( negative influence and persuasive argument communication) that, according to previous modelingwork, can be expected to make conflicting predictions about the relationship between segregation and opinion polarization. With a Schelling-type agent-based model of residential segregation, we generate initial environments with different levels of group segregation. Then we simulate the two processes of opinion dynamics. We show that the negative influence model predicts segregation to hinder the emergence of opinion polarization. On the other hand, the persuasive argument model predicts that segregation does not substantially foster polarization. Moreover, we explore how the spatial patterns of opinion distribution differs between the models: in particular, we investigate the likelihood that group membership and opinion align. We show that the alignment of group membership and opinions differs between the two opinion formation models, and that the scale at which we measure alignment plays a crucial role.

AB The performance variation and its associated factors of a polymer composites over a wide temperature range need to be particularly concerned in engineering application. In this article, on the basis of molecular dynamics simulation analysis and experimental verification of glass transition temperature (T-g) of neat epoxy resins and single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT)/epoxy composites with two structures of aromatic diamines curing agents, the elastic modulus of systems were studied from cryogenic temperature (100 K) until near the T-g in depth. Both simulation and experimental results showed that the thermal and mechanical performance of amine-epoxy systems were enhanced obviously after incorporating SWCNTs of 1 wt% and stiffer amine curing agent molecules, and the elastic modulus was declining as the temperature rising. Further, some microstructure parameters of resin molecules influencing the elastic modulus of amine-epoxy systems were analyzed, including the cohesive energy density (CED), free volume fraction (FFV), and mean square displacement. Among them, both CED and FFV can be significantly affected by addition of SWCNTs and different amine curing agent, and were closely related to the temperature, which can act as novel criteria to predict and optimize some thermal and mechanical performances of crosslinked resin systems and their composites for serving under different temperature.

AB The argument of this paper is predicated on the view that social science should start with observation and the specification of a problem to be solved. On that basis, the appropriate properties and conditions of application of relevant tools of analysis should be defined. Evidence is adduced from data for sales volumes and values of a disparate range of goods to show that frequency distributions are commonly fat-tailed. This result implies that any stable population distribution will generally have infinite variance and perhaps undefined mean. Models with agents that reason about their behavior and are influenced by, but do not imitate, other agents known to them will typically generate fat-tailed time series data. A simulation model of intermediated exchange is reported that is populated by such agents and yields the same type of fat-tailed time series and cross-sectional data that is found in data for fast moving consumer goods and for retail outlets. This result supports the proposition that adaptive agent models of markets with agents that reason and are socially embedded have the same statistical signatures as real markets. Whereas this statistical signature precludes any conventional hypothesis testing or forecasting, these models do offer unique opportunities for validation on the basis of domain expertise and qualitative data. Perhaps the most striking conclusion is that neither current social theory nor any similar construct will ever support an effective policy analysis. However, adaptive agent modeling is an effective substitute when embedded in a wider policy analysis procedure.

AB The purpose of this paper is to present a spatial agent-based model of N-person prisoner's dilemma that is designed to simulate the collective communication and cooperation within a socio-geographic community. Based on a tight coupling of REPAST and a vector Geographic Information System, the model simulates the emergence of cooperation from the mobility behaviors and interaction strategies of citizen agents. To approximate human behavior, the agents are set as stochastic learning automata with Pavlovian personalities and attitudes. A review of the theory of the standard prisoner's dilemma, the iterated prisoner's dilemma, and the N-person prisoner's dilemma is given as well as an overview of the generic architecture of the agent-based model. The capabilities of the spatial N-person prisoner's dilemma component are demonstrated with several scenario simulation runs for varied initial cooperation percentages and mobility dynamics. Experimental results revealed that agent mobility and context preservation bring qualitatively different effects to the evolution of cooperative behavior in an analyzed spatial environment.

AB Activity-driven modelling has recently been proposed as an alternative growth mechanism for time varying networks, displaying power-law degree distribution in time-aggregated representation. This approach assumes memoryless agents developing random connections with total disregard of their previous contacts. Thus, such an assumption leads to time-aggregated random networks that do not reproduce the positive degree-degree correlation and high clustering coefficient widely observed in real social networks. In this paper, we aim to study the incidence of the agents' long-term memory on the emergence of new social ties. To this end, we propose a dynamical network model assuming heterogeneous activity for agents, together with a triadic-closure step as main connectivity mechanism. We show that this simple mechanism provides some of the fundamental topological features expected for real social networks in their time-aggregated picture. We derive analytical results and perform extensive numerical simulations in regimes with and without population growth. Finally, we present an illustrative comparison with two case studies, one comprising face-to-face encounters in a closed gathering, while the other one corresponding to social friendship ties from an online social network.

AB This paper studies the diffusion of greenhouse agriculture in a watershed in the northern uplands of Thailand by applying econometrics and agent-based modeling in combination. Adoption has been rapid by farmers in the central valley of the watershed, while farmers at higher altitudes, lacking transferable land titles that could serve as mortgage collateral, have been unable to obtain loans for greenhouse investment. The objectives of the paper are both methodological and empirical. On the methodological side, it shows that econometrically estimated models of farm household behavior are useful to design and to parameterize an agent-based model. On the empirical side, simulation results show that if mortgage collateral would not be required, then adoption in the upper part of the watershed could reach nearly 77% of farm households by 2020, as compared to about 36% under current conditions. Furthermore results suggest a significant increase in incomes related to the innovation and a substantially greater irrigation water use, especially in the central part. As bell pepper under greenhouses has replaced pesticide-intensive chrysanthemum, it has declined average levels of pesticide use. Nevertheless, pesticide use is high and farmers are struggling to control pests, which raises questions about the long-term sustainability of the innovation.

AB Coordinated motion and collective decision-making in fish schools result from complex interactions by which individuals integrate information about the behavior of their neighbors. However, little is known about how individuals integrate this information to take decisions and control their motion. Here, we combine experiments with computational and robotic approaches to investigate the impact of different strategies for a fish to interact with its neighbors on collective swimming in groups of rummy-nose tetra (Hemigrammus rhodostomus). By means of a data-based agent model describing the interactions between pairs of H. rhodostomus (Calovi et al., 2018), we show that the simple addition of the pairwise interactions with two neighbors quantitatively reproduces the collective behavior observed in groups of five fish. Increasing the number of interacting neighbors does not significantly improve the simulation results. Remarkably, and even without confinement, we find that groups remain cohesive and polarized when each agent interacts with only one of its neighbors: the one that has the strongest contribution to the heading variation of the focal agent, dubbed as the "most influential neighbor". However, group cohesion is lost when each agent only interacts with its nearest neighbor. We then investigate by means of a robotic platform the collective motion in groups of five robots. Our platform combines the implementation of the fish behavioral model and a control system to deal with real-world physical constraints. A better agreement with experimental results for fish is obtained for groups of robots only interacting with their most influential neighbor, than for robots interacting with one or even two nearest neighbors. Finally, we discuss the biological and cognitive relevance of the notion of "most influential neighbors". Overall, our results suggest that fish have to acquire only a minimal amount of information about their environment to coordinate their movements when swimming in groups.
   Author summary
   How do fish integrate and combine information from multiple neighbors when swimming in a school? What is the minimum amount of information about their environment needed to coordinate their motion? To answer these questions, we combine experiments with computational and robotic modeling to test several hypotheses about how individual fish could integrate and combine the information on the behavior of their neighbors when swimming in groups. Our research shows that, for both simulated agents and robots, using the information of two neighbors is sufficient to qualitatively reproduce the collective motion patterns observed in groups of fish. Remarkably, our results also show that it is possible to obtain group cohesion and coherent collective motion over long periods of time even when individuals only interact with their most influential neighbor, that is, the one that exerts the most important effect on their heading variation.

ID CONTINGENCY; COGNITION
AB This paper continues efforts to establish a mutually informative dialogue between psychology and evolutionary robotics in order to investigate the dynamics of social interaction. We replicate a recent simulation model of a minimalist experiment in perceptual crossing and confirm the results with significantly simpler artificial agents. A series of psycho-physical tests of their behaviour informs a hypothetical circuit model of their internal operation. However, a detailed study of the actual internal dynamics reveals this circuit model to be unfounded, thereby offering a tale of caution for those hypothesising about sub-personal processes in terms of behavioural observations. In particular, it is shown that the behaviour of the agents largely emerges out of the interaction process itself rather than being an individual achievement alone. We also extend the original simulation model in two novel directions in order to test further the extent to which perceptual crossing between agents can self-organise in a robust manner. These modelling results suggest new hypotheses that can become the basis for further psychological experiments.

AB Bullying is a widespread phenomenon, occurring in many countries; however, until recently, knowledge of it was limited due to the lack of access to information. Also, most parents of K-12 students failed to see it as an important issue. Now, it is widely agreed upon that bullying is common and detrimental. Use of media outlets to disseminate this message is helping to gradually chip away at this previously ignored problem. Hence, bullying behavior is difficult to detect immediately and prevent. This study uses a simulation model based on the social impact theory to study the changing roles of a class of 40 students during a semester long period. The students in the class were divided into three roles: the bullies, the victims and the bystanders. The model also defines a new criterion, the "bullying index,'' designed to shed light on the underlying dynamics of bullying through experimental design. Regression results show that the percentage of students bullied in school lessened significantly when the environment changed. The parental and persuasiveness constants were significant, while the impact of counseling was not, even after intensive counseling. This means that we should separate bullies', bystanders' and victims' education to prevent bullying behaviors.

AB Despite attempts to enhance the recycling of waste printed circuit boards (WPCBs), the simultaneous recovery of major metals of WPCBs using an efficient approach is still a great challenge. This study mainly concerned with applying an effective statistical tool to optimize the recovery of metal content (i.e., Cu, Fe, Zn, Pb, Ni, Sn, and Al) embedded in WPCBs using a leaching agent without any additive or oxidative agent. Another target was to optimize a multi-response recovery process by minimizing time, energy, and acid consumption during the leaching. Effective parameters and their levels, including leaching time (20-60 min), temperature (25-45 degrees C), solid to liquid (S/L) ratio (1/8-1/20 g/ml), and acid molarity (1-2.7 M), were optimized. A well-established statistical approach (i.e., response surface methodology (RSM)) was applied to precisely quantify and interpret the effects. General optimum conditions for nine responses were introduced with the desirability of approximate to 85%. Finally, the solid residue of leaching was characterized and results showed the morphology, structure, and composition of the residue content (i.e., polymers and ceramics) remained the same after the leaching, indicating the neutral behavior of the leaching process on these two materials. Also, thermal behavior and phase analysis of the original WPCBs and leaching residue were compared and analyzed.

AB In this paper, we study how agents' social learning behavior influences market volatility and how the flash crash emerges. We build a model of order-driven market, in which agents use a combination of four components to form their return anticipations: a social learning component, a chartist component, a fundamentalist component and a noise induced component. By numerical simulations, we find that social learning plays a doubleedged role in market volatilities. On the one hand, social learning plays a role in reducing total price volatilities and stabilizing the market. On the other hand, in some excitable regimes, social learning instead acts as the critical factor contributing to a flash crash. More interestingly, the lower volatility associated with social learning in the stable regime is crucial to give birth to a flash crash. In addition, we do some robust analyses on the roles of social learning by running the model under many different parameter settings. With the increase of the social learning innate parameter, both the average draw-down and draw-up, the average spread and the average gap show a downward trend. Meanwhile, the tail exponents for the draw-downs and draw-ups also show a downward trend, confirming that social learning plays a double-edged role. The chartist belief can stabilize the market when the social influence is not so trusted, while the chartist belief transfers to contribute to the market instability when the social influence is sufficiently trusted. The fundamentalist belief shows quite opposite impacts in respect to the chartist belief. Finally, we summarize typical return and volatility patterns before a flash crash, which will give some inspirations to regulators and investors. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE

DE social care; kinship networks; agent-based modelling
AB Current demographic trends in the UK include a fast-growing elderly population and dropping birth rates, and demand for social care among the aged is rising. The UK depends on informal social care-family members or friends providing care-for some 50% of care provision. However, lower birth rates and a greying population mean that care availability is becoming a significant problem, causing concern among policy-makers that substantial public investment in formal care will be required in decades to come. In this paper, we present an agent-based simulation of care provision in the UK, in which individual agents can decide to provide informal care, or pay for private care, for their loved ones. Agents base these decisions on factors including their own health, employment status, financial resources, relationship to the individual in need and geographical location. Results demonstrate that the model can produce similar patterns of care need and availability as are observed in the real world, despite the model containing minimal empirical data. We propose that our model better captures the complexities of social care provision than other methods, due to the socioeconomic details present and the use of kinship networks to distribute care among family members.

AB The goal of this paper is to verify how behavioural and social features influence the decisions of market makers and to identify the impact that such decisions have on the trade volume, price levels and bid-ask spreads observed in the market. Many classical microstructural models explain the rational behaviour of market makers. We can distinguish two main groups of such models: information-based models and inventory-based ones. On the one hand, information-based models emphasise the role of the informational asymmetry between market makers and informed traders. On the other hand, inventory-based models relate the behaviour of market makers to the current status of inventories. In particular, the objective of the market maker is to either avoid bankruptcy or merely maintain an inventory balance. It is known, however, that it is not just rational factors which may influence economic behaviour. In particular, based on the literature, we stipulate that such personal traits as risk attitude, impulsivity, social behaviour and sense of fairness may influence market makers' behaviour. To verify this, we conducted a series of experiments with the goal of analysing the relation between these factors and market maker behaviour. Participants in these experiments played the role of a market maker in the simulated options market. Experimental data enabled us to analyse how the behavioural traits influence individual decisions. However, due to missing interactions among market makers during the experiment, the data did not enable us to analyse how these traits influence the aggregated observed markets parameters, such as trading volume and mean spread in a competitive market. Therefore, we propose a formal agent-based model that makes it possible to investigate how behavioural factors influence market variables such as price and volume by means of the simulation.

AB Behavioral simulation plays an important role in many scenarios, such as emergency evacuation and public safety. The importance of public security in modern life can be seen in the epidemic outbreak in 2020. In particular, the epidemic can affect peoples psychology and emotions and change peoples behavior. Therefore, how to effectively improve peoples positive emotions in a panic has become an urgent problem. In social relations, most behaviors are produced by peer interaction. To simulate the interactions among peers more realistically, this paper studies the diversity and efficiency of evacuation behaviors from the trust of peers, the strength of social relations and empathy. First, a general framework of peer relationships is constructed based on asymmetric intimacy, including the relationship between intimacy relationship modeling. Then, the problem of the dynamic formation of peer groups is studied by employing the calculation method of asymmetric intimacy. The effect of positive emotion transmission mechanism on peer interaction behaviors is explored through asymmetric intimacy. Finally, the companion behaviors of the peers in several scenarios are simulated. The proposed method is compared with different emotion contagion models and the behavioral simulation models. Experimental results show that the positive emotions contagion of the peer behavior simulation method can concrete the macro group behavior and effectively simulate the peer group in an evacuation. The simulation effects are diverse and efficient.

AB Facilitators that use a collaborative governance approach are regularly pushed, mandated, or naturally desire to achieve broad inclusion of stakeholders in collaborations. How to achieve such inclusion is an important but often overlooked aspect of implementation. To fully realize the value of collaborative governance, we investigate how institutional design choices made about inclusion practices during the critical early stages of collaboration affect stakeholders' expectations of each other's contribution to a civic program and subsequently influences collaboration process outcomes. Informed by field observations from uniquely successful community health programs, we identify two institutional design choices related to inclusion that are associated with favorable group outcomes. The first design process uses time instrumentally to build trust and commitment in the collaboration, whereas the second design process includes new participants thoughtfully to limit their risk exposure. Based on experimental economics, strategic behaviors of stakeholders are formalized as a minimum effort coordination game in a multiagent model. A series of simulated experiments are conducted to gain fine-grained understanding of how the two design processes uniquely engender and reinforce commitment among stakeholders, minimize uncertainty, and increase the likelihood of positive process outcomes. For practitioners, the findings suggest how to navigate collaboration tensions during the early stages of their development while still respecting the competing need for stakeholder inclusiveness. The theoretical framework and the multiagent method of this study embrace the complexity of collaborative processes and trace how each intervention uniquely contributes to increases in trust and commitment.

AB Agent-based approaches to simulating long-term location and mobility decisions and short-term activity and travel decisions of households and individuals are receiving increasing attention in land-use and transportation interaction (LUTI) models to predict land-use changes and travel behaviour in mutual interaction. Social interactions between households and between individuals potentially have an influence on a wide range of the long-term and short-term choices involved in these systems. In this paper we identify the areas in which social interactions play a role and address the question how these influences can be modelled in the context of agent-based LUTI models. We distinguish impacts on activity participation (joint activity participation, support-and-help activities) and impacts on decision making (information exchange, social adaptation of preferences and aspirations) as the two main areas of social influence. A prototype of a LUTI model is proposed that accounts for impacts of the social network on longer-term mobility decision making through information exchange and social adaptation of preferences and aspirations. The model is demonstrated in a numerical simulation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Agent-based models (ABMs) are increasingly recognized as valuable tools in modelling human environmental systems, but challenges and critics remain. One pressing challenge in the era of "Big Data" and given the flexibility of representation afforded by ABMs, is identifying the appropriate level of complicatedness in model structure for representing and investigating complex real-world systems. In this paper, we differentiate the concepts of complexity (model behaviour) and complicatedness (model structure), and illustrate the non-linear relationship between them. We then systematically evaluate the trade-offs between simple (often theoretical) models and complicated (often empirically-grounded) models. We propose using pattern-oriented modelling, stepwise approaches, and modular design to guide modellers in reaching an appropriate level of model complicatedness. While ABMs should be constructed as simple as possible but as complicated as necessary to address the predefined research questions, we also warn modellers of the pitfalls and risks of building "mid-level" models mixing stylized and empirical components.

AB While there are several existing agent-based systems addressing the crucial and difficult issues of automated negotiation and auction, this research has designed and engineered a society of trading agents with two distinguishing features: 1) a market-driven negotiation strategy and 2) a deal optimizing auction protocol. Unlike some of the existing systems where users manually select predefined trading strategies, in the market-driven approach, trading agents automatically select the appropriate strategies by examining the changing market situations. Results from a series of experiments suggest that the market-driven approach generally achieved more favorable outcomes as compared to the fixed strategy approach. Furthermore, it provides a more intuitive simulation of trading because trading agents are able to respond to different market situations with appropriate strategies. By augmenting the auction protocol with a deal optimization stage, trading agents can be programmed to optimize transaction deals by delaying the finalization of deals in search of better deals. Experimental results showed that by having a deal optimization stage, the auction protocol produced generally optimistic outcomes.

AB When reviewing the present state of the art in agent-based models of social processes, one may encounter three basic types of models: theory-based models start with a set of assumptions about human behavior and test those assumptions in various scenarios; data-driven models are based on mass data (e. g. census, large surveys) and usually include a large number of agents; a third group of models combines different data sources and may also include qualitative information, that is, text descriptions of human behavior. Pushing this notion further, the motivation of this paper is to demonstrate how an agent-based model of a political process can be designed only using the stakeholders' own descriptions and observation results. The simulation reproduces the discussions among the stakeholders and their subsequent decisions and is able to react to changes in their general settings. The simulation outcomes are also produced in text format so that they are easily understandable to stakeholders and other users. The simulation can be used to explore different sets of rules for the decision processes and their results.

AB The co-authorship among members of a research group commonly can be represented by a (co-authorship) graph in which nodes represent the researchers that make up of this group and edges represent the connections between two agents (i.e., the co-authorship between these agents). Current study measures the reliability of networks by taking into consideration unreliable nodes (researchers) and perfectly reliable edges (co-authorship between two researchers). A Bayesian approach for the reliability of a network represented by the co-authorship among members of a real research group is proposed, obtaining Bayesian estimates and credibility intervals for the individual components (nodes or researchers) and the network. Weakly informative and non-informative prior distributions are assumed for those components and the posterior summaries are obtained by Monte Carlo-Markov Chain methods. The results show the relevance of an inferential approach for the reliability of scientific co-authorship network. The results also demonstrate that the contribution of each researcher is highly relevant for the maintenance of a research group. In addition, the Bayesian methodology was a feasible and easy computational implementation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Cascades; social networks; threshold model; coordination game; best
   response; random graphs; local mean-field
AB The spread of new beliefs, behaviors, conventions, norms, and technologies in social and economic networks are often driven by cascading mechanisms, and so are contagion dynamics in financial networks. Global behaviors generally emerge from the interplay between the structure of the interconnection topology and the local agents' interactions. We focus on the Threshold Model (TM) of cascades first introduced by Granovetter (1978). This can be interpreted as the best response dynamics in a network game whereby agents choose strategically between two actions. Each agent is equipped with an individual threshold representing the number of her neighbors who must have adopted a certain action for that to become the agent's best response. We analyze the TM dynamics on large-scale networks with heterogeneous agents. Through a local mean-field approach, we obtain a nonlinear, one-dimensional, recursive equation that approximates the evolution of the TM dynamics on most of the networks of a given size and distribution of degrees and thresholds. We prove that, on all but a fraction of networks with given degree and threshold statistics that is vanishing as the network size grows large, the actual fraction of adopters of a given action is arbitrarily close to the output of the aforementioned recursion. Numerical simulations on some real network testbeds show good adherence to the theoretical predictions.

ID LANGUAGE EVOLUTION
AB Human language is unparalleled in both its expressive capacity and its diversity. What accounts for the enormous diversity of human languages [13]? Recent evidence suggests that the structure of languages may be shaped by the social and demographic environment in which the languages are learned and used. In an analysis of over 2000 languages Lupyan and Dale [25] demonstrated that socio-demographic variables, such as population size, significantly predicted the complexity of inflectional morphology. Languages spoken by smaller populations tend to employ more complex inflectional systems. Languages spoken by larger populations tend to avoid complex morphological paradigms, employing lexical constructions instead. This relationship may exist because of how language learning takes place in these different social contexts [44, 45]. In a smaller population, a tightly-knit social group combined with exclusive or almost exclusive language acquisition by infants permits accumulation of complex inflectional forms. In larger populations, adult language learning and more extensive cross-group interactions produce pressures that lead to morphological simplification. In the current paper, we explore this learning-based hypothesis in two ways. First, we develop an agent-based simulation that serves as a simple existence proof: As adult interaction increases, languages lose inflections. Second, we carry out a correlational study showing that English-speaking adults who had more interaction with non-native speakers as children showed a relative preference for over-regularized (i.e. morphologically simpler) forms. The results of the simulation and experiment lend support to the linguistic niche hypothesis: Languages may vary in the ways they do in part due to different social environments in which they are learned and used. In short, languages adapt to the learning constraints and biases of their learners.

AB The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of social intentions on action. Participants (N = 13) were requested to reach towards, grasp an object, and either pass it to another person (social condition) or put it on a concave base (single-agent condition). Movements' kinematics was recorded using a three-dimensional motion analysis system. The results indicate that kinematics is sensitive to social intention. Movements performed for the 'social' condition were characterized by a kinematic pattern which differed from those obtained for the 'single-agent' condition. Results are discussed in terms of a motor simulation hypothesis, which assumes that the same mechanisms underlying motor intention are sensitive to social intentions. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB Information systems such as social media strongly influence public opinion formation. Additionally, communication on the internet is shaped by individuals and organisations with various aims. This environment has given rise to phenomena such as manipulated content, fake news, and social bots. To examine the influence of manipulated opinions, we draw on the spiral of silence theory and complex adaptive systems. We translate empirical evidence of individual behaviour into an agent-based model and show that the model results in the emergence of a consensus on the collective level. In contrast to most previous approaches, this model explicitly represents interactions as a network. The most central actor in the network determines the final consensus 60-70% of the time. We then use the model to examine the influence of manipulative actors such as social bots on public opinion formation. The results indicate that, in a highly polarised setting, depending on their network position and the overall network density, bot participation by as little as 2-4% of a communication network can be sufficient to tip over the opinion climate in two out of three cases. These findings demonstrate a mechanism by which bots could shape the norms adopted by social media users.

AB The interaction between residential preferences and dwellings is a complex system whose function thus far remains insufficiently explored. In this paper, we investigate housing functions as orchestrators of households' residential mobility in the context of Swiss rental housing. We propose a theoretical multi-step model and use survey data from 878 Swiss tenants to inspect the model's linkages. From the statistical analysis, we firstly observe that tenants' residential satisfaction is more likely to increase when the gap between ideal housing functions and those actually fulfilled by the current dwelling decreases. Secondly, results show that the effectiveness of an event (e.g. a job opportunity) in triggering the move is significantly related to both residential satisfaction and the functions the dwelling fulfils prior to the trigger. Thirdly, findings show that these trigger events can be grouped into three types: radical change, problem-solving and opportunity. With a medium effect size, a radical change was found to bring about the strongest change in housing functions between past and current dwellings. Lastly, in line with the hypothesis that residential preferences vary over the life course, socio-demographic characteristics and tenancy types are found to be significant explanatory variables for households' ideal housing functions. By disentangling the complexity of the housing system, the proposed multi-step model can be used to integrate households' preferences with supply-side constraints in agent-based model simulations, thereby contributing to fostering the provision of quality housing, i.e. dwellings able to meet the needs of current and future occupants.

AB Touristic cities will suffer from COVID-19 emergency because of its economic impact on their communities. The first emergency phases involved a wide closure of such areas to support "social distancing" measures (i.e. travels limitation; lockdown of (over)crowd-prone activities). In the "second phase", individual's risk-mitigation strategies (facial masks) could be properly linked to "social distancing" to ensure re-opening touristic cities to visitors. Simulation tools could support the effectiveness evaluation of risk-mitigation measures to look for an economic and social optimum for activities restarting. This work modifies an existing Agent-Based Model to estimate the virus spreading in touristic areas, including tourists and residents' behaviours, movement and virus effects on them according to a probabilistic approach. Consolidated proximity-based and exposure-time-based contagion spreading rules are included according to international health organizations and previous calibration through experimental data. Effects of tourists' capacity (as "social distancing"-based measure) and other strategies (i.e. facial mask implementation) are evaluated depending on virus-related conditions (i.e. initial infector percentages). An idealized scenario representing a significant case study has been analysed to demonstrate the tool capabilities and compare the effectiveness of those solutions. Results show that "social distancing" seems to be more effective at the highest infectors' rates, although represents an extreme measure with important economic effects. This measure loses its full effectiveness (on the community) as the infectors' rate decreases and individuals' protection measures become predominant (facial masks). The model could be integrated to consider other recurring issues on tourist-related fruition and schedule of urban spaces and facilities (e.g. cultural/leisure buildings).

AB Street demonstrations occur across the world. In Rio de Janeiro, in June/July 2013, they reach beyond one million people. A wrathful reader of 0 Globo, a leading newspaper in the same city, published a letter (Ferreira (2011) [10]) where many social questions are stated and answered Yes or No. These million people of street demonstrations share opinion consensus about a similar set of social issues. But they did not reach this consensus within such a huge numbered meeting. Earlier, they have met in diverse small groups where some of them could be convinced to change their mind by other few fellows. Suddenly, a macroscopic consensus emerges. Many other big manifestations are widespread all over the world in recent times, and are supposed to remain in the future. The interesting questions are: (1) How a binary-option opinion distributed among some population evolves in time, through local changes that occurred within small-group meetings? and (2) Is there some natural selection rule acting upon? Here, we address these questions through an agent-based model. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Putaminal metabolites examined using cross-sectional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can distinguish pre-manifest and early Huntington's Disease (HD) individuals from controls. An ideal biomarker, however, will demonstrate longitudinal change over short durations. The objective here was to evaluate longitudinal in vivo brain metabolite profiles in HD over 24 months. Eighty-four participants (30 controls, 25 pre-manifest HD, 29 early HD) recruited as part of TRACK-HD were imaged at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months using 3T MRS of left putamen. Automated putaminal volume measurement was performed simultaneously. To quantify partial volume effects, spectroscopy was performed in a second, white matter voxel adjacent to putamen in six subjects. Subjects underwent TRACK-HD motor assessment. Statistical analyses included linear regression and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). At all time-points N-acetyl aspartate and total N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), neuronal integrity markers, were lower in early HD than in controls. Total NAA was lower in pre-manifest HD than in controls, whereas the gliosis marker myo-inositol (MI) was robustly elevated in early HD. Metabolites were stable over 24 months with no longitudinal change. Total NAA was not markedly different in adjacent white matter than putamen, arguing against partial volume confounding effects in cross-sectional group differences. Total NAA correlations with disease burden score suggest that this metabolite may be useful in identifying neurochemical responses to therapeutic agents. We demonstrate almost consistent group differences in putaminal metabolites in HD-affected individuals compared with controls over 24 months. Future work establishing spectroscopy as an HD biomarker should include multi-site assessments in large, pathologically diverse cohorts. (c) 2015 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society

ID RATIONALITY
AB A growing tradition in analyzing bargaining behaviour uses an experimental setup to control parameters of the underlying conflict. Game theory is used to model the conflict, to analyze the possible actions of the agents and the arguments that can be used within the bargaining process, and to understand the results of the bargaining. In face-to-face bargaining especially, large variations occur in the results within a given class of situations (with the same game used). It is a major task of bargaining research to explain this variance. This task requires a bounded rationality approach. In an earlier paper I reported some results on the influence of the social field on the bargaining process. This paper deals with individual aspiration processing as a further explanation for the course and results of observed bargaining sequences. Simulations based on individual aspiration processing are compared with experimental data; the fit is imperfect but some of the deviations can be explained.

AB Social media users can easily be offended or hurt on those platforms, which leads to discomfort and health issues such as stress and anxiety. Forgiveness plays an important role to maintain healthy online relationships, which is the central constituent of social dynamics, from cooperation to social cohesion. While most prior studies have focused on analyzing forgiveness factors in offline settings using statistical methods, this study offers a new perspective using a two-staged approach whereby a research model was tested using structural equation modeling (SEM), and then the results were used as inputs for artificial neural network (ANN) and fuzzy logic (FL) models. An agent-based simulation was then performed to shed light on a possible use of the implemented models. Combining ANN and FL provided more accurate prediction results. In addition, simulation experiments call attention to the potential benefits of forgiveness in maintaining connectedness in a social network. The main purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the applicability of soft computing techniques on forgiveness prediction. Instead of relying on data mining techniques, we looked into questions that can improve our understanding of how society works in a digital age. In addition, this study provides an interesting example of a different and insightful way of doing computational social science that is useful to both researchers and practitioners.

AB According to aviation statistics, most of the safety occurrences happen not in the air, but on the ground. Management of airlines and airports often consider failures to comply with safety-related regulations as important contributors to safety occurrences. To address the issue of compliance, approaches based on external regulation of the employees' behavior were proposed. Unfortunately, an externally imposed control is often not internalized by employees and has a short-term effect on their performance. To achieve a long-term effect, employees need to be internally motivated to adhere to regulations. To understand the role of motivation for compliance in ground service organizations, in this paper a formal agent-based model is proposed based on theories from social science with a wide empirical support. The model incorporates cognitive, social, and organizational aspects. The model was simulated and partially validated by a case study performed at a real airline ground service organization. The model was able to reproduce behavioral patterns related to compliance of the platform employees in this study. Based on the model, global sensitivity analysis was performed. The results of this analysis together with the simulation results were used to generate recommendations to improve compliance.

AB In this paper we present the results of a simulation study of credence developments in groups of communicating Bayesian agents, as they update their beliefs about a given proposition p. Based on the empirical literature, one would assume that these groups of rational agents would converge on a view over time, or at least that they would not polarize. This paper presents and discusses surprising evidence that this is not true. Our simulation study shows that these groups of Bayesian agents show group polarization behavior under a broad range of circumstances. This is, we think, an unexpected result, that raises deeper questions about whether the kind of polarization in question is irrational. If one accepts Bayesian agency as the hallmark of epistemic rationality, then one should infer that the polarization we find is also rational. On the other hand, if we are inclined to think that there is something epistemically irrational about group polarization, then something must be off in the model employed in our simulation study. We discuss several possible interfering factors, including how epistemic trust is defined in the model. Ultimately, we propose that the notion of Bayesian agency is missing something in general, namely the ability to respond to higher-order evidence.

AB At present, novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV, the causative agent of COVID-19) has caused worldwide social and economic disruption. The disturbing statistics of this infection promoted us to develop an effective vaccine candidate against the COVID-19. In this study, bioinformatics approaches were employed to design and introduce a novel multi-epitope vaccine against 2019-nCoV that can potentially trigger both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell immune responses and investigated its biological activities by computational tools. Three known antigenic proteins (Nucleocapsid, ORF3a, and Membrane protein, hereafter called NOM) from the virus were selected and analyzed for prediction of the potential immunogenic B and T-cell epitopes and then validated using bioinformatics tools. Based on in silico analysis, we have constructed a multi-epitope vaccine candidate (NOM) with five rich-epitopes domain including highly scored T and B-cell epitopes. After predicting and evaluating of the third structure of the protein candidate, the best 3 D predicted model was applied for docking studies with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and HLA-A*11:01. In the next step, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was used to evaluate the stability of the designed fusion protein with TLR4 and HLA-A*11:01 receptors. MD studies demonstrated that the NOM-TLR4 and NOM-HLA-A*11:01 docked models were stable during simulation time. In silico evaluation showed that the designed chimeric protein could simultaneously elicit humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma

AB Multi-target drugs against particular multiple targets get better protection, resistance profiles and curative influence by cooperative rules of a key beneficial target with resistance behavior and compensatory elements. Computational techniques can assist us in the efforts to design novel drugs (ligands) with a preferred bioactivity outline and alternative bioactive molecules at an early stage. A number of in silico methods have been explored extensively in order to facilitate the investigation of individual target agents and to propose a selective drug. A different, progressively more significant field which is used to predict the bioactivity of chemical compounds is the data mining method. Some of the previously mentioned methods have been investigated for multi-target drug design (MTDD) to find drug leads interact simultaneously with multiple targets. Several cheminformatics methods and structure-based approaches try to extract information from units working cooperatively in a biomolecular system to fulfill their task. To dominate the difficulties of the experimental specification of ligand-target structures, rational methods, namely molecular docking, SAR and QSAR are vital substitutes to obtain knowledge for each structure in atomic insight. These procedures are logically successful for the prediction of binding affinity and have shown promising potential in facilitating MTDD. Here, we review some of the important features of the multi-target therapeutics discoveries using the computational approach, highlighting the SAR, QSAR, docking and pharmacophore methods to discover interactions between drug-target that could be leveraged for curative benefits. A summary of each, followed by examples of its applications in drug design has been provided. Computational efficiency of each method has been represented according to its main strengths and limitations.

AB The eigenstrain theory provides a range of fruitful concepts for advanced modelling of the behaviour of materials and components obtained using sophisticated manufacturing routes, their response to thermal and mechanical loading, and deformation under fatigue and creep conditions. In recent years the method has been shown to be able to provide predictions of residual stresses for a limited range of processing and simulated service conditions for which experimental data is available. The authors recently presented advances in the use of eigenstrain-based analysis to include accurate determination of the domain and boundaries of eigenstrain fields in the weld zone. This approach allowed effective modelling of large-scale components and the determination of volumetric distributions of residual stresses through the use of additional model coefficients that need to be determined. Due to the non-linear dependence of the prediction on these parameters, the algorithm of the decision-making process has a profound influence on the cost of the simulation, and the reliability of its output. To address this challenge, the principles of Artificial Intelligence were adopted for use in the eigenstrain contour method to develop fuzzy Finite Element Model (fFEM) for the eigenstrain the reconstruction of residual stresses in large structures. The deterministic finite element eigenstrain model uses contour measurements for reconstruction process, and the developed fFEM behaves as an artificial agent to determine the coefficients of the deterministic finite element eigenstrain model. As an example application, as-welded and post-weld heat-treated specimens of non-uniform weldments of Inconel Alloy 740H were investigated using the proposed model. The results were verified using displacement measurements and residual stress calculations of the contour method. The determination of model coefficients by artificial agent allowed effective reconstruction of volumetric residual stresses in complex shaped components using limited data without the requirement of costly and destructive multi-cut experimental procedures.

AB Several theories have been proposed to explain societal environmental injustices. Studies based on standard statistical methods and empirical data are often limited in testing some of these theories. This is especially true when some potential reasons (eg, racism) for unjust environmental outcomes are invidious, and even individual-level methods (eg, surveys) are unlikely to be effective in detecting them. We use agent-based modeling to explore the circumstances under which racially defined environmental injustice occurs in a society. We test three competing theories of an environmental disamenity's location decision: cost factors alone, benign intention for the majority population, or malign intention for the minority population, along with three scenarios of residential similarity preferences. The simulation demonstrates that a purely neoclassical world-one in which firms and residents care only about costs-does not lead to environmental injustice. Nor does a similar world in which disamenity-producing firms seek to locate away from majority residents. Instead, two conditions led to societal environmental injustice: when disamenity-producing firms aim to locate near minorities or when residents prefer to live near other residents like themselves. In our model, a race-conscious society rather than just a collection of race-conscious firms produced significant levels of environmental injustice.

AB Motivated by various clinical applications of ultrasound contrast agents within blood vessels, the natural frequencies of two bubbles in a compliant tube are studied analytically, numerically, and experimentally. A lumped parameter model for a five degree of freedom system was developed, accounting for the compliance of the tube and coupled response of the two bubbles. The results were compared to those produced by two different simulation methods: (1) an axisymmetric coupled boundary element and finite element code previously used to investigate the response of a single bubble in a compliant tube and (2) finite element models developed in COMSOL Multiphysics. For the simplified case of two bubbles in a rigid tube, the lumped parameter model predicts two frequencies for in- and out-of-phase oscillations, in good agreement with both numerical simulation and experimental results. For two bubbles in a compliant tube, the lumped parameter model predicts four nonzero frequencies, each asymptotically converging to expected values in the rigid and compliant limits of the tube material.

AB This paper suggests a model of the process through which a set of symbols, initially without any intrinsic meaning, acquires endogenously a conventional and socially shared meaning. This model has two related aspects. The first is the cognitive aspect, represented by the process through which each agent processes the information gathered during the interactions with other agents. In this paper, the agents are endowed with the cognitive skills necessary to categorize the input in a lexicographic way, a categorization process that is implemented by the means of data mining techniques. The second aspect is the social one, represented by the process of reiterate interactions among the agents who compose a population. The framework of this social process is that of evolutionary game theory, with a population of agents who are randomly matched in each period in order to play a game that, in this paper, is a kind of signaling game. The simulations show that the emergence of a socially shared meaning associated to a combination of symbols is, under the assumptions of this model, a statistically inevitable occurrence.

AB In this paper we propose and evaluate a method for studying technology adoption at the national level using hybrid simulation. A hybrid simulation model is developed which combines elements of system dynamics and agent-based modelling, and treats nations as adopting agents. International diffusion is modelled as a social system where the adoption of an innovation, or even just growing pressure to adopt an innovation, in one nation can then influence its adoption in others. The model is used to investigate nine different technological innovations for which sufficient international data are available. Using the available empirical data, the method of differential evolution is used to configure the model which allows the parameter space to be explored in an efficient manner, without bias or subjective disagreement. Good agreement is found between the parameters derived in this way and those reported to configure analytic models. For each of the nine innovations, we report the rank order correlation between the actual order of adoption of the innovations by nations and the order predicted by the simulation model. We also report the rank order correlations between the actual order and the order predicted by a much simpler statistical model. Improvements in the rank order correlation are shown when some form of social influence between nations is included, although there is no significant difference in results between the four different types of social influence considered by the simulation. The nine technologies investigated also appear to fall into two groups with significantly different uptake speeds. Advantages and limitations of the approach are discussed along with suggested implications for practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB For the first time, the adsorption of pesticides such as azinphos-methyl and methamidophos by polyamidoamine (PAMAM) derivatives was studied. Amine groups of PAMAM (G4 and G5) were functionalized with different biomolecules such as folic acid, coumarine, arginine, lysine, and asparagine. Subsequently, the synthesized compounds were used to trap organophosphates (OP), and its affinity to do so was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The obtained experimental data was compared with the interaction energy values obtained through a nanoinformatic methodology, by using conformational sampling through Euler angles and semi-empirical quantum mechanical calculations. Both, the experimental and the in silico methodology can be employed to screen with high accuracy the molecular interactions between OP agents and the functionalized PAMAM. Furthermore, affinity results by HPLC and molecular dynamics were supported by in vitro enzyme acetylcholinesterase activity assays.

AB All feline species are territorial, but only African lions defend joint territories. We developed a simulation model to explore the conditions that favor the transition to sociality from a solitary ancestry. Two ecological "drivers," population density and landscape heterogeneity, determine the extent to which social groups benefit from monopolizing resource-rich "hot spots." However, group territoriality only evolves where individuals remain with their mothers, cooperate to repel neighbors, and expand their territories to maximize access to resources.Group territoriality is exhibited in a diverse range of species and is associated with complex behaviors such as cooperation and altruism. Current hypotheses for the evolutionary transition from solitary to group territoriality consider resource dispersion and population density as the primary drivers. We developed a spatially explicit, agent-based simulation model based on African lions (Panthera leo) to explore the evolution of group territoriality across a range of landscape heterogeneities and population densities. We also examined, within these differing landscapes, how 3 potential behavioral advantages to group territoriality (cooperative defense, increase in territory size, and territorial inheritance) influence the evolution of this trait. Simulation results demonstrate that group territoriality may be an emergent property, which evolves due to synergistic interactions of landscape structure, population density, and behavior. Social individuals were significantly more likely to dominate in both resource-poor and resource-rich, heterogeneous landscapes where individuals exhibit all 3 behavioral traits. Similar environment-behavior interactions may have shaped the evolution of sociality from solitary territoriality across a broad range of taxa.

AB The paper is aimed at developing agent-based variants of traditional network models that make full use of concurrency. First, we review some classic models of the static structure of complex networks with the objective of developing agent-based models suited for simulating a large-scale, technology-enabled social network. Secondly, we outline the basic properties that characterize such networks. Then, we briefly discuss some classic network models and the properties of the networks they generate. Finally, we discuss how such models can be converted into agent-based models (i) to be executed more easily in heavily concurrent environments and (ii) to serve as basic blocks for more complex agent-based models. We evidence that many implicit assumptions made by traditional models regarding their execution environment are too expensive or outright impossible to maintain in concurrent environments. Consequently, we present the concurrency issues resulting from the violation of such assumptions. Then, we experimentally show that, under reasonable hypothesis, the agent-based variants maintain the main features of the classic models, notwithstanding the change of environment. Eventually, we present a meta-model that we singled out from the individual classic models and that we used to simplify the agent-oriented conversion of the traditional models. Finally, we discuss the software tools that we built to run the agent-based simulations.

ID TRUST
AB Credit networks are an abstraction for modeling trust among agents in a network. Agents who do not directly trust each other can transact through exchange of IOUs (obligations) along a chain of trust in the network. Credit networks are robust to intrusion, can enable transactions between strangers in exchange economies, and have the liquidity to support a high rate of transactions. We study the formation of such networks when agents strategically decide how much credit to extend each other. We find strong positive network formation results for the simplest theoretical model. When each agent trusts a fixed set of other agents and transacts directly only with those it trusts, all pure-strategy Nash equilibria are social optima. However, when we allow transactions over longer paths, the price of anarchy may be unbounded. On the positive side, when agents have a shared belief about the trustworthiness of each agent, simple greedy dynamics quickly converge to a star-shaped network, which is a social optimum. Similar star-like structures are found in equilibria of heuristic strategies found via simulation studies. In addition, we simulate environments where agents may have varying information about each others' trustworthiness based on their distance in a social network. Empirical game analysis of these scenarios suggests that star structures arise only when defaults are relatively rare, and otherwise, credit tends to be issued over short social distances conforming to the locality of information. Overall, we find that networks formed by self-interested agents achieve a high fraction of available value, as long as this potential value is large enough to enable any network to form.

AB Social network analysis, which has been widely adopted in animal studies over the past decade, enables the revelation of global characteristic patterns of animal social systems from pairwise inter-individual relations. Animal social networks are typically drawn based on the geometric proximity and/or frequency of social behaviours (e.g. grooming), but the appropriate metric for inter-individual relationship is not clear, especially when prior knowledge on the species/data is limited.
   In this study, researchers explored a nonparametric analysis of inter-individual relations using a neural network with the attention mechanism, which plays a central role in natural language processing. The high interpretability of the attention mechanism and flexibility of the entire neural network allow for automatic detection of inter-individual relations included in the raw data, without requiring prior knowledge/assumptions about what modes/types of relations are included in the data. For these case studies, three-dimensional location data collected from simulated agents and real Japanese macaques were analysed.
   The proposed method successfully recovered the latent relations behind the simulated data and discovered female-oriented relations in the real data, which are in accordance with the previous generalizations about the macaque social structure.
   The proposed method does not exploit any behavioural patterns that are particular to Japanese macaques, and researchers can use it for location data of other animals. The flexibility of the neural network would also allow for its application to a wide variety of data with interacting components, such as vocal communication.

AB The Living Earth Simulator (LES) is one of the core components of the FuturICT architecture. It will work as a federation of methods, tools, techniques and facilities supporting all of the FuturICT simulation-related activities to allow and encourage interactive exploration and understanding of societal issues. Society-relevant problems will be targeted by leaning on approaches based on complex systems theories and data science in tight interaction with the other components of FuturICT. The LES will evaluate and provide answers to real-world questions by taking into account multiple scenarios. It will build on present approaches such as agent-based simulation and modeling, multiscale modelling, statistical inference, and data mining, moving beyond disciplinary borders to achieve a new perspective on complex social systems.

AB When people express their opinions about a certain issue, they often give uncertain opinions rather than exact opinions. Particularly, these uncertain opinions will evolve in social networks. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on investigating uncertain opinion formation with social networks under bounded confidence. Specifically, we define the uncertain opinions by numerical interval opinions, whose ranges are between zero and one, and the larger width of numerical interval opinions means the more uncertainty of the opinions. Meanwhile, we describe social network structures by ER random graphs with different agents' scales and network connected probabilities. Then, we present the detailed simulation experiments to reveal the strong impact of social network structures on uncertain opinion formation. Simulation results show that: 1) larger agents' scales will yield the smaller ratios of agents expressing the uncertain opinions and larger average widths of uncertain opinions; 2) the average stable time starts increasing and then decreases with the increase in the network connected probabilities; and 3) larger network connected probabilities will yield less opinion clusters and the smaller ratios of the extremely small clusters in all clusters. The obtained results are helpful for the government and public opinion management departments to understand and manage uncertain public opinion evolution effectively.

AB One typical reflection of our understanding on multiagent systems (MASs) is our ability to design the emergence mechanism responsible for their various cooperative behaviors. This paper is concerned with the cooperative robust containment control problem of multileader MASs subject to unknown nonlinear dynamics and external disturbances. Specifically, quasi-containment and asymptotic containment problems are, respectively, considered by using tools from neural network (NN) approximation theory and Lyapunov stability theory of nonsmooth systems. A new kind of containment controllers consisting of a linear local information-based feedback term, a neuroadaptive approximation term and a nonsmooth feedback term are designed to complete the goal of quasi-containment. Under the assumption that the subgraph depicting the coupling configuration among followers is detail-balanced and each follower can be influenced by at least one leader, it is proven that the containment error vector of the closed-loop MASs will be uniformly ultimately bounded if the control parameters of the proposed containment controllers are suitably designed. By introducing a pseudo ideal weighting matrix for NN approximator embedded at each follower, a novel class of containment controllers are further designed to precisely achieve asymptotic containment in the considered MASs where the Euclidean norm of containment error vector asymptotically converges to zero. At last, numerical simulations are given to verify the validity of these derived theoretical results.

AB In many dynamic open systems, autonomous agents must interact with one another to achieve their goals. Such agents may be self-interested and, when trusted to perform an action, may betray that trust by not performing the action as required. Due to the scale and dynamism of these systems, agents will often need to interact with other agents with which they have little or no past experience. Each agent must therefore be capable of assessing and identifying reliable interaction partners, even if it has no personal experience with them. To this end, we present HABIT, a Hierarchical And Bayesian Inferred Trust model for assessing how much an agent should trust its peers based on direct and third party information. This model is robust in environments in which third party information is malicious, noisy, or otherwise inaccurate. Although existing approaches claim to achieve this, most rely on heuristics with little theoretical foundation. In contrast, HABIT is based exclusively on principled statistical techniques: it can cope with multiple discrete or continuous aspects of trustee behaviour; it does not restrict agents to using a single shared representation of behaviour; it can improve assessment by using any observed correlation between the behaviour of similar trustees or information sources; and it provides a pragmatic solution to the whitewasher problem (in which unreliable agents assume a new identity to avoid bad reputation). In this paper, we describe the theoretical aspects of HABIT, and present experimental results that demonstrate its ability to predict agent behaviour in both a simulated environment, and one based on data from a real-world webserver domain. In particular, these experiments show that HABIT can predict trustee performance based on multiple representations of behaviour, and is up to twice as accurate as BLADE, an existing state-of-the-art trust model that is both statistically principled and has been previously shown to outperform a number of other probabilistic trust models.

AB Power differences are ubiquitous in social settings. However, the question of whether groups with higher or lower power disparity achieve better performance has thus far received conflicting answers. To address this issue, we identify 3 underlying assumptions in the literature that may have led to these divergent findings, including a myopic focus on static hierarchies, an assumption that those at the top of hierarchies are competent at group tasks, and an assumption that equality is not possible. We employ a multimethod set of studies to examine these assumptions and to understand when power disparity will help or harm group performance. First, our agent-based simulation analyses show that by unpacking these common implicit assumptions in power research, we can explain earlier disparate findings-power disparity benefits group performance when it is dynamically aligned with the power holder's task competence, and harms group performance when held constant and/or is not aligned with task competence. Second, our empirical findings in both a field study of fraud investigation groups and a multiround laboratory study corroborate the simulation results. We thereby contribute to research on power by highlighting a dynamic understanding of power in groups and explaining how current implicit assumptions may lead to opposing findings.

AB We present a model of social learning of both language and skills, while assuming-insofar as possible-strict autonomy, virtual embodiment, and situatedness. This model is built by integrating various previous models of language development and social learning, and it is this integration that, under the mentioned assumptions, provides novel challenges. The aim of the article is to investigate what sociocognitive mechanisms agents should have in order to be able to transmit language from one generation to the next so that it can be used as a medium to transmit internalized rules that represent skill knowledge. We have performed experiments where this knowledge solves the familiar poisonous-food problem. Simulations reveal under what conditions, regarding population structure, agents can successfully solve this problem. In addition to issues relating to perspective taking and mutual exclusivity, we show that agents need to coordinate interactions so that they can establish joint attention in order to form a scaffold for language learning, which in turn forms a scaffold for the learning of rule-based skills. Based on these findings, we conclude by hypothesizing that social learning at one level forms a scaffold for the social learning at another, higher level, thus contributing to the accumulation of cultural knowledge.

AB Male rats were exposed to a low-intensity (300 500 nT) electromagnetic (EM) field designed to simulate primed burst potentiation (PB) for 30 min preceding a one-trial olfactory learning task involving two brief encounters a with a juvenile rat during a baseline (reference) and an experimental (EM) trial. The amount of time spent engaged in behaviors defining social investigation (i.e., sniffing, grooming) during the second encounter of the experimental trial was significantly elevated in adult rats receiving continuous EM stimulation prior to the initial encounter. These results support the hypothesis that LTP-like stimulation disrupts the acquisition of a learning task if the stimulus is delivered before training.

AB The paper presents results from two groups of experimental tests on a pressurised vascular self-healing cementitious material system, in which low viscosity cyanoacrylate was employed as the healing-agent. The first group comprised three series of tests on plain concrete notched prismatic beams. These tests examined the effects on the mechanical response of varying the healing period, the rate of loading and the healing-agent pressure. The second group involved two series of direct tension tests on doubly notched prismatic specimens, each of which had a different crack opening displacement during the healing period. In this second group of tests, healing was allowed to take place in cracks that were held stationary for a period of time, with the degree of mechanical healing being measured for different healing periods. The paper also presents a simplified damage-healing model that is used to interpret the test results and to bring clarity to the indices used to evaluate the degree of healing. The tests were designed to provide new data on simultaneous damage-healing behaviour as well as on the effects of varying pressure, static healing periods and cracking configurations on the mechanical response of this self-healing cementitious material (SHCM) system. These data have been used to guide the development of a new numerical model for SHCMs (reported elsewhere) and should be useful to others who are developing design procedures and/or computational models for similar material systems.

AB Sclerotherapy is the chemical occlusion of vessels using an intravenous injection of a liquid or foamed sclerosing agent that is used in the therapy of blood and lymphatic vessels malformations in the young, and for spider veins, smaller varicose veins, hemorrhoids and hydroceles in adults. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of mechanosclerotherapy of venous veins with a new device-Flebogrif(R)-based on an animal model. The experiment was performed on nine Polish Merino sheep weighing 40-50 kilograms. The animals were anesthetized intravenously. The material was divided into three groups: two experimental (1 and 2) and control (3) group. The first experimental group was treated with the use of Flebogrif(R) and a sclerosant simultaneously, while only Flebogrif(R) was used in the second experimental group. Flebogrif(R) was applied into the lateral saphenous vein of both pelvic limbs. The vessel wall thickness was estimated at four points of the histological image in mm (V1, V2, V3, V4). For one month, the animals were euthanized, and the occlusion rate of the treated veins and changes in the vein wall were determined. Histological slides were analyzed under a light microscope and histometry of the vein wall was performed. The Shapiro-Wilk test and the quantity of the investigated parameter groups allowed for using a non-parametric method at four points to compare thickness measurements (the Mann-Whitney test), with p < 0.05. The Mann-Whitney test indicated statistically significant differences between both experimental groups. The results obtained from morphometrical and histological analysis showed better results in the first experimental group than those of the second experimental group. Finally, statistical analysis revealed significant differences between the both the experimental group and control group in morphological analysis. The achieved results allowed us to conclude that the simultaneous use of Flebogrif(R) and a sclerosant yielded better results of vein lumen reduction than the use of Flebogrif(R) alone.

SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B

ID TRANSMITTED-DISEASES; COMPLEX NETWORKS; CONTACTS; PATTERNS
AB We present a novel model to simulate real social networks of complex interactions, based in a system of colliding particles (agents). The network is build by keeping track of the collisions and evolves in time with correlations which emerge due to the mobility of the agents. Therefore, statistical features are a consequence only of local collisions among its individual agents. Agent dynamics is realized by an event-driven algorithm of collisions where energy is gained as opposed to physical systems which have dissipation. The model reproduces empirical data from networks of sexual interactions, not previously obtained with other approaches.

AB Computational simulations are currently used to identify epidemic dynamics, to test potential prevention and intervention strategies, and to study the effects of social behaviors on HIV transmission. The author describes an agent-based epidemic simulation model of a network of individuals who participate in high-risk sexual practices, using number of partners, condom usage, and relationship length to distinguish between high-and low-risk populations. Two new concepts-free links and fixed links-are used to indicate tendencies among individuals who either have large numbers of short-termpartners or stay in long-term monogamous relationships. An attempt was made to reproduce epidemic curves of reported HIV cases among male homosexuals in Taiwan prior to using the agent-based model to determine the effects of various policies on epidemic dynamics. Results suggest that when suitable adjustments are made based on available social survey statistics, the model accurately simulates real-world behaviors on a large scale.

AB In various branches of the social sciences, agent-based models (ABMs) have long been applied to enhance researchers' understanding of complex systems and processes. However, in communication science, this approach is rarely used. In this article, we argue that ABMs have the potential to advance communication research in general, and computational communication science (CCS) in particular, by helping scholars address two major gaps. First, by generating emergent global phenomena from individual interactions, ABMs make it possible to explicitly link micro and macro perspectives in communication research. Second, by formalizing theories, ABMs offer mechanism-based explanations for observed empirical patterns in data. To familiarize more communication scholars with this approach, this article provides a systematic overview of the potentials, applications, and challenges of ABMs in communication science. Special attention is paid to the criteria of reliability and validity.

AB The diffusion of electric vehicles (EVs) is considered an effective policy strategy to meet greenhouse gas reduction targets. For large-scale adoption, however, demand-side oriented policy measures are required, based on consumers' transport needs, values and social norms. We introduce an empirically grounded, spatially explicit, agent-based model, InnoMind (Innovation diffusion driven by changing Minds), to simulate the effects of policy interventions and social influence on consumers' transport mode preferences. The agents in this model represent individual consumers. They are calibrated based on empirically derived attributes and characteristics of survey respondents. We model agent decision-making with artificial neural networks that account for the role of emotions in information processing. We present simulations of 4.scenarios for the diffusion of EVs in the city of Berlin, Germany (3 policy scenarios and 1 base case). The results illustrate the varying effectiveness of measures in different market segments and the need for appropriate policies tailored to the heterogeneous needs of different travelers. Moreover, the simulations suggest that introducing an exclusive zone for EVs in the city would accelerate the early-phase diffusion of EVs more effectively than financial incentives only.

AB Carbon nanotubes have caught tremendous attention of the researchers during the last decade due to their excellent mechanical, electrical, optical and thermal properties. The exploitation of these fibers as reinforcing agents in making strong fiber composites has been a primary research topic in the recent investigations on composite materials. Although the theoretical results are rather optimistic, the goal of achieving high strength of the carbon nanotube composites is still not satisfactorily realized. We report here a comparative study of the mechanical properties of single-walled, multi-walled and bundle of single-walled carbon nanotubes. Their mechanical behavior is investigated by molecular dynamics simulation, considering Brenner's second generation reactive empirical bond order interatomic potential between the carbon atoms making a tube. For a long range interaction, we have defined a weak van der Waals force which acts between different layers of a multi-walled tube or between different tubes of a bundle. Samples of three isolated armchair single-wall carbon nanotubes of different diameters, a multi-wall armchair carbon nanotube and finally a bundle of three armchair single-walled nanotubes of same diameter are taken. Their fracture pattern and buckling behavior are modeled and compared. Significant changes are observed in the mechanical properties of the samples of different types of carbon nanotubes which arise due to the interaction between the shells of a multi-walled tube or the tubes in a bundle.

AB In peacekeeping, domestic, or combat operations, unanticipated crowd confrontations can occur. As a highly dynamic social group, human crowd in confrontation is a fascinating phenomenon. This paper presents a novel method based on the concept of vector field to formulate the way in which external stimuli may affect the behaviours of individuals in a crowd. Furthermore, Modelling & Simulation (M&S) of large crowds at individual level has long been placed in the highly computation intensive world. This study adopts GPGPU to sustain massively parallel M&S of a confrontation operation involving a large crowd. This approach enables investigation of a crowd consisting of tens of thousands individuals whose size was prohibitively large for conventional M&S technique to support. Experimental results indicate that the approach is efficient in terms of both performance and energy consumption.

AB There are crack interfaces between self-healing agent and cement matrix in smart encapsulation-based self-healing concrete, whose mechanical properties significantly affects the load capacity recovery of crack-healed concrete. In this study, both experimental and numerical investigations were conducted on the crack-healed concrete under uniaxial tension to investigate the interface bonding behaviours and the self-healing agent distribution on the crack surface. The results show that the bonding behaviour of the crack interface depends on the content of healing agent and mechanical properties of the crack surface. However, it is still difficult to accurately understand their effects on the bonding behaviour by experimental investigation due to the high brittleness of the crack interface and the discrepancy of self-healing concrete. Therefore, based on the experimental results, a novel numerical model of the interface between self-healing agent and cement matrix was developed to investigate effects of aggregates, pores and interface properties on the bonding behaviour of crack interface by the cohesive surface technique (CS). Parametric analysis was also performed on the bonding behaviours and a method was proposed for assessing the load capacity of crack-healed concrete. Based on the experimental and numerical investigations on the healing agent-concrete crack interface in the smart encapsulation-based self-healing concrete, this novel numericla methods can be used to assess the recovery efficiency and performance of smart self-healing concrete structure.

AB Energy technology adoption is a complex process, involving social, behavioral, and economic factors that impact individual decision-making. This paper uses an empirical, geographic information system (GIS)-integrated agent-based model of residential solar photovoltaic (PV) adoption to explore the importance of using empirical household-level data and of incorporating economic as well as social and behavioral factors on model outcomes. Our goal is to identify features of the model that are most critical to successful prediction of the temporal, spatial, and demographic patterns that characterize the technology adoption process for solar PV. Agent variables, topology, and environment are derived from detailed and comprehensive real-world data between 2004 and 2013 in Austin (Texas, USA). Four variations of the model are developed, each with a different level of complexity and empirical characterization. We find that while an explicit focus only on the financial aspects of the solar PV adoption decision performs well in predicting the rate and scale of adoption, accounting for agent-level attitude and social interactions are critical for predicting spatial and demographic patterns of adoption with high accuracy.

AB The experimental results proved that a liquid and commercial chelating agent (DTCR) with dithiocarbamate (DTC) groups could be used to further remove toxic metal ions from the simulated metallic mine wastewater with trace amount of mixed metal ions. Under the optimized operating conditions, just a little dosage of DTCR (the volume ratio of DTCR to wastewater about 1: 104) could make the removal rate of Cr3+, Cu2+, Pb2+, Zn2+ and Cd2+ in the treated water reach 99.70%, 99.28%, 99.10%, 92.33% and 91.49%, respectively. The residual content of the five ions were 0.003, 0.036, 0.009, 0.383 and 0.085 mg/L, which were all obviously lower than the contents required in the emission standard except of Zn2+ and Cd2+. The removal ability followed the order of Cr3+> Cu2+> Pb2+> Zn2+> Cd2+. The characterization revealed that the major functional groups in DTCR were DTC groups (-NCS2) and amino groups (-NH-, -NH2 or -NR2) which were not on DTC groups. The removal mechanisms of these functional groups were investigated by the combination of experimental methods and density functional theory (DFT) calculation, which demonstrated that all the five metal ions could be captured by the metal-ligand bonds between ions and C=S/C-S on DTC groups. But Cr3+, Cu2+ and Pb2+ could be further captured by the electron donation of N atom on -NH2 and -NH- which were not on DTC groups. Moreover, Cr3+ could be further adsorbed by the secondary N atom on DTC group. The relation between the functional groups and metal ions could be calculated quantitatively based on the removal mechanisms. It could well explain the removal ability of DTCR for different metal ions and provide a scientific guideline for the further modification of chelating agent with DTC groups to improve its removal efficiency for Zn2+ and Cd2+ in the depth treatment of wastewater with trace amount of mixed toxic metal ions.

AB It is important to know whether the laws or phenomena in statistical physics for natural systems with non-adaptive agents still hold for social human systems with adaptive agents, because this implies whether it is possible to study or understand social human systems by using statistical physics originating from natural systems. For this purpose, we review the role of human adaptability in four kinds of specific human behaviors, namely, normal behavior, herd behavior, contrarian behavior, and hedge behavior. The approach is based on controlled experiments in the framework of market-directed resource-allocation games. The role of the controlled experiments could be at least two-fold: adopting the real human decision-making process so that the system under consideration could reflect the performance of genuine human beings; making it possible to obtain macroscopic physical properties of a human system by tuning a particular factor of the system, thus directly revealing cause and effect. As a result, both computer simulations and theoretical analyses help to show a few counterparts of some laws or phenomena in statistical physics for social human systems: two-phase phenomena or phase transitions, entropy-related phenomena, and a non-equilibrium steady state. This review highlights the role of human adaptability in these counterparts, and makes it possible to study or understand some particular social human systems by means of statistical physics coming from natural systems.

AB A model of crowd motion that considers each pedestrian as a Newtonian particle subject to both physical and social forces was reported by Helbing, Farkas, and Vicsek in 2000. Subsequent numerical simulations of this model, performed by its authors, showed that it exhibits realistic crowd behavior. In this article, the authors point out that numerical values of certain parameters in that model may produce counterintuitive results when applied to the motion of an isolated pedestrian or a small number of pedestrians. They have considered modifications of the original model, which allow them to use parameter values that, in the aforementioned sense, are more realistic. However, this is achieved by introducing more features and parameters into the original model. These features are described, and some results of the numerical simulations of the modified model are presented. Two major results of their study need to be mentioned. First, they developed an algorithm, based on an explicit numerical integration scheme, which prevents simulated pedestrians from overlapping with one another in physical space. Second, they demonstrated how the form of the social repulsive force between two pedestrians may be deduced from certain measured characteristics of pedestrian flows.

AB When agents interact socially with different intentions (or wills), conflicts are difficult to avoid. Although the means by which social agents can resolve such problems autonomously has not been determined, dynamic characteristics of agency may shed light on underlying mechanisms. Therefore, the current study focused on the sense of agency, a specific aspect of agency referring to congruence between the agent's intention in acting and the outcome, especially in social interaction contexts. Employing predictive coding and active inference as theoretical frameworks of perception and action generation, we hypothesize that regulation of complexity in the evidence lower bound of an agent's model should affect the strength of the agent's sense of agency and should have a significant impact on social interactions. To evaluate this hypothesis, we built a computational model of imitative interaction between a robot and a human via visuo-proprioceptive sensation with a variational Bayes recurrent neural network, and simulated the model in the form of pseudo-imitative interaction using recorded human body movement data, which serve as the counterpart in the interactions. A key feature of the model is that the complexity of each modality can be regulated differently by changing the values of a hyperparameter assigned to each local module of the model. We first searched for an optimal setting of hyperparameters that endow the model with appropriate coordination of multimodal sensation. These searches revealed that complexity of the vision module should be more tightly regulated than that of the proprioception module because of greater uncertainty in visual information flow. Using this optimally trained model as a default model, we investigated how changing the tightness of complexity regulation in the entire network after training affects the strength of the sense of agency during imitative interactions. The results showed that with looser regulation of complexity, an agent tends to act more egocentrically, without adapting to the other. In contrast, with tighter regulation, the agent tends to follow the other by adjusting its intention. We conclude that the tightness of complexity regulation significantly affects the strength of the sense of agency and the dynamics of interactions between agents in social settings.

AB We study the joint evolution of worldviews by proposing a model of opinion dynamics, which is inspired in notions from evolutionary ecology. Agents update their opinion on a specific issue based on their propensity to change-asserted by the social neighbors-weighted by their mutual similarity on other issues. Agents are, therefore, more influenced by neighbors with similar worldviews (set of opinions on various issues), resulting in a complex co-evolution of each opinion. Simulations show that the worldview evolution exhibits events of intermittent polarization when the social network is scale-free. This, in turn, triggers extreme crashes and surges in the popularity of various opinions. Using the proposed model, we highlight the role of network structure, bounded rationality of agents, and the role of key influential agents in causing polarization and intermittent reformation of worldviews on scale-free networks.

AB Conservation takes place within social-ecological systems, and many conservation interventions aim to influence human behaviour in order to push these systems towards sustainability. Predictive models of human behaviour are potentially powerful tools to support these interventions. This is particularly true if the models can link the attributes and behaviour of individuals with the dynamics of the social and environmental systems within which they operate. Herewe explore this potential by showing howcombining two modelling approaches (social network analysis, SNA, and agent-based modelling, ABM) could lead to more robust insights into a particular type of conservation intervention. We use our simple model, which simulates knowledge of ranger patrols through a hunting community and is based on empirical data from a Cambodian protected area, to highlight the complex, context-dependent nature of outcomes of information-sharing interventions, depending both on the configuration of the network and the attributes of the agents. We conclude by reflecting that both SNA and ABM, and many other modelling tools, are still too compartmentalized in application, either in ecology or social science, despite the strong methodological and conceptual parallels between their uses in different disciplines. Even a greater sharing of methods between disciplines is insufficient, however; given the impact of conservation on both the social and ecological aspects of systems (and vice versa), a fully integrated approach is needed, combining both the modelling approaches and the disciplinary insights of ecology and social science.
   This article is part of the theme issue 'Linking behaviour to dynamics of populations and communities: application of novel approaches in behavioural ecology to conservation'.

AB This article studies topology inference, from agent states, of a directed cyber-social network with opinion spreading dynamics model that explicitly takes confirmation bias into account. The cyber-social network comprises a set of partially connected directed network of agents at the social level, and a set of information sources at the cyber layer. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of exact inference solution are characterized. A method for exact inference, when it is possible, of entire network topology as well as confirmation bias model parameters is proposed for the case where the bias mentioned earlier follows a piece-wise linear model. The particular case of no confirmation bias is analyzed in detail. For the setting where the model of confirmation bias is unknown, an algorithm that approximates the network topology, building on the exact inference method, is presented. This algorithm can exactly infer the weighted communication from the neighbors to the non-followers of information sources. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods for different scenarios.

AB Background and Objectives: SARS-CoV-2 emerged in December 2019 and rapidly spread into a global pandemic. Designing optimal community responses (social distancing, vaccination) is dependent on the stage of the disease progression, discovery of asymptomatic individuals, changes in virulence of the pathogen, and current levels of herd immunity. Community strategies may have severe and undesirable social and economic side effects. Modeling is the only available scientific approach to develop effective strategies that can minimize these unwanted side effects while retaining the effectiveness of the interventions.
   Methods: We extended the agent-based model, SpatioTemporal Human Activity Model (STHAM), for simulating SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics.
   Results: Here we present preliminary STHAM simulation results that reproduce the overall trends observed in the Wasatch Front (Utah, United States of America) for the general population. The results presented here clearly indicate that human activity patterns are important in predicting the rate of infection for different demographic groups in the population.
   Conclusions: Future work in pandemic simulations should use empirical human activity data for agent-based techniques. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB With growing opportunities for individually motivated agents to work collaboratively to satisfy shared goals, it becomes increasingly important to design agents that can make intelligent decisions in the context of commitments to group activities. In particular, agents need to be able to reconcile their intentions to do team-related actions with other, conflicting intentions. We present the SPIRE experimental system that allows the process of intention reconciliation in team contexts to be simulated and studied. SPIRE enables us to examine the influence of team norms and environmental factors on team members faced with conflicting intentions, as well as the effectiveness of different intention-reconciliation on strategies. We discuss results from pilot experiments that confirm the reasonableness of our model of the problem and illustrate some of the issues involved, and we lay the groundwork for future experiments that will allow us to derive principles for designers of collaboration-capable agents.

TI Complex contagions with timers
SO CHAOS
LA English
DT Article
ID SOCIAL-INFLUENCE; MODEL; DIFFUSION; CASCADES
AB There has been a great deal of effort to try to model social influence-including the spread of behavior, norms, and ideas-on networks. Most models of social influence tend to assume that individuals react to changes in the states of their neighbors without any time delay, but this is often not true in social contexts, where (for various reasons) different agents can have different response times. To examine such situations, we introduce the idea of a timer into threshold models of social influence. The presence of timers on nodes delays adoptions-i.e., changes of state-by the agents, which in turn delays the adoptions of their neighbors. With a homogeneously-distributed timer, in which all nodes have the same amount of delay, the adoption order of nodes remains the same. However, heterogeneously-distributed timers can change the adoption order of nodes and hence the "adoption paths" through which state changes spread in a network. Using a threshold model of social contagions, we illustrate that heterogeneous timers can either accelerate or decelerate the spread of adoptions compared to an analogous situation with homogeneous timers, and we investigate the relationship of such acceleration or deceleration with respect to the timer distribution and network structure. We derive an analytical approximation for the temporal evolution of the fraction of adopters by modifying a pair approximation for the Watts threshold model, and we find good agreement with numerical simulations. We also examine our new timer model on networks constructed from empirical data. Published by AIP Publishing.

TI DELAY OF SOCIAL SEARCH ON SMALL-WORLD GRAPHS

ID ACQUAINTANCE NETWORKS; CHAINS; MODEL; SIZE; NAVIGATION
AB This article introduces an analytical framework for two small-world network models and studies the delay of targeted social search by considering messages traveling between source and target individuals in these networks. In particular, by considering graphs constructed on different network domains, such as rectangular, circular, and spherical network domains, analytical solutions for the average social search delay and the delay distribution are obtained as functions of source-target separation, distribution of the number of long-range connections and geometrical properties of network domains. Derived analytical formulas are first verified by agent-based simulations and then compared with empirical observations in small-world experiments. These formulas indicate that individuals tend to communicate with one another only through their short-range contacts and the average social search delay rises linearly, when the separation between the source and target is small. As this separation increases long-range connections are more commonly used, and the average social search delay rapidly saturates to a constant value and stays almost the same for all large values of the separation. These results do not require the dimensionality of the social space to be identical to the decay exponent of long-range social connections and are qualitatively consistent with experimental observations made by Travers and Milgram in 1969 as well as by others. Moreover, analytical distributions for the delay of social search predicted by the models introduced in this article are also compared with corresponding empirical distributions, and good statistical matches between them are observed. Other somewhat surprising conclusions of the article are that hubs have limited effect in reducing the delay of social search and variation in node degree distribution adversely affects this delay.

ID DECISION-MAKING; NEURAL BASIS; COOPERATION; SIMULATION; MIND
AB Previous studies of strategic social interaction in game theory have predominantly used games with clearly-defined turns and limited choices. Yet, most real-world social behaviors involve dynamic, coevolving decisions by interacting agents, which poses challenges for creating tractable models of behavior. Here, using a game in which humans competed against both real and artificial opponents, we show that it is possible to quantify the instantaneous dynamic coupling between agents. Adopting a reinforcement learning approach, we use Gaussian Processes to model the policy and value functions of participants as a function of both game state and opponent identity. We found that higher-scoring participants timed their final change in direction to moments when the opponent's counter-strategy was weaker, while lower-scoring participants less precisely timed their final moves. This approach offers a natural set of metrics for facilitating analysis at multiple timescales and suggests new classes of experimental paradigms for assessing behavior.

AB Within the context of partisan selective exposure and attitude polarization, this study investigates a mutually reinforcing spiral model, aiming to clarify mechanisms and boundary conditions that affect spiral processesinterpersonal agreement and disagreement, and the ebb and flow of message receptions. Utilizing agent-based modeling (ABM) simulations, the study formally models endogenous dynamics of cumulative processes and its reciprocal effect of media choice behavior over extended periods of time. Our results suggest that interpersonal discussion networks, in conjunction with election contexts, condition the reciprocal effect of selective media exposure and its attitudinal consequences. Methodologically, results also highlight the analytical utility of computational social science approaches in overcoming the limitations of typical experimental and observations studies.

AB The current rate of production and consumption of meat poses a problem both to peoples' health and to the environment. This work aims to develop a simulation of peoples' meat consumption in Britain using agent-based modelling. The agents represent individual consumers. The key variables that characterise agents include sex, age, monthly income, perception of the living cost, and concerns about the impact of meat on the environment, health, and animal welfare. A process of peer influence is modelled with respect to the agents' concerns. Influence spreads across two eating networks (i.e. co-workers and household members) depending on the time of day, day of the week, and agents' employment status. Data from a representative sample of British consumers is used to empirically ground the model. Different experiments are run simulating interventions of the application of social marketing campaigns and a rise in price of meat. The main outcome is the mean weekly consumption of meat per consumer. A secondary outcome is the likelihood of eating meat. Analyses are run on the overall artificial population and by subgroups. The model succeeded in reproducing observed consumption patterns. Different sizes of effect on consumption emerged depending on the application of a social marketing strategy or a price increase. A price increase had a greater effect than environmental and animalwelfare campaigns, while a health campaign had a larger impact on consumers' behaviour than the other campaigns. An environmental campaign targeted at consumers concerned about the environment produced a boomerang effect increasing the consumption in the population rather than reducing it. The results of the simulation experiments are mainly consistent with the literature on food consumption providing support for future models of public strategies to reduce meat consumption.

ID SOCIAL-INTERACTION; COGNITION; DYNAMICS; OTHERS
AB Researchers in social cognition increasingly realize that many phenomena cannot be understood by investigating offline situations only, focusing on individual mechanisms and an observer perspective. There are processes of dynamic emergence specific to online situations, when two or more persons are engaged in a real-time interaction that are more than just the sum of the individual capacities or behaviors, and these require the study of online social interaction. Auvray et al.'s (2009) perceptual crossing paradigm offers possibly the simplest paradigm for studying such online interactions: two persons, a one-dimensional space, one bit of information, and a yes/no answer. This study has provoked a lot of resonance in different areas of research, including experimental psychology, computer/robot modeling, philosophy, psychopathology, and even in the field of design. In this article. we review and critically assess this body of literature. We give an overview of both behavioral experimental research and simulated agent modeling done using the perceptual crossing paradigm. We discuss different contexts in which work on perceptual crossing has been cited. this includes the controversy about the possible constitutive role of perceptual crossing for social cognition. We conclude with an outlook on future research possibilities, in particular those that could elucidate the link between online interaction dynamics and individual social cognition.

AB A two stage multi-fraction 1st-order kinetic model was established herein, which incorporates Cd species distribution in the contaminated site, chelate dosage and washing time, and two distinct extraction mechanisms are also emphasized there. The model was found to successfully simulate the experimental data of Cd extraction by EDTA; with the obtained parameters, we also got a similarly good agreement in other two Cd-contaminated soils. All normalized root-mean-square error, the index of agreement and modeling efficiency values showed that this model can be used to predict Cd kinetic extraction process in different types of soils with an excellent validity. Both simulated and experimental results indicate that a greater EDTA dosage reasonably leads to a higher Cd extraction efficiency and a faster extraction by the direct EDTA-complex. Different Cd species also show different extraction behavior. Part of Cd species associated with Fe/Mn hydro(oxides) (FeMnOx) become destabilized by slow EDTA-promoted dissolution but not yet detached, leading to an apparently high removal efficiency of Cd in FeMnOx fraction dependent on EDTA dosage. While the removal of exchangeable Cd and carbonates (EXCH+CARB) seemed unchanged with the EDTA dosage, due to the transformation of the undetached Cd in FeMnOx fractions. However, an extreme dosage (i.e. molar ratio of EDTA to metal equal to 20 herein) may accelerate the detachment of these destabilized Cd species, resulting in a substantially high extraction efficiency of EXCH+CARB fraction.

AB In the last decade, instigated by the Paris agreement and United Nations Climate Change Conferences (COP22 and COP23), the efforts to limit temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels are expanding. The required reductions in greenhouse gas emissions imply a massive decarbonization worldwide with much involvement of regions, cities, businesses, and individuals in addition to the commitments at the national levels. Improving end-use efficiency is emphasized in previous IPCC reports (IPCC 2014). Serving as the primary 'agents of change' in the transformative process towards green economies, households have a key role in global emission reduction. Individual actions, especially when amplified through social dynamics, shape green energy demand and affect investments in new energy technologies that collectively can curb regional and national emissions. However, most energy-economics models-usually based on equilibrium and optimization assumptions-have a very limited representation of household heterogeneity and treat households as purely rational economic actors. This paper illustrates how computational social science models can complement traditional models by addressing this limitation. We demonstrate the usefulness of behaviorally rich agent-based computational models by simulating various behavioral and climate scenarios for residential electricity demand and compare them with the business as usual (SSP2) scenario. Our results show that residential energy demand is strongly linked to personal and social norms. Empirical evidence from surveys reveals that social norms have an essential role in shaping personal norms. When assessing the cumulative impacts of these behavioral processes, we quantify individual and combined effects of social dynamics and of carbon pricing on individual energy efficiency and on the aggregated regional energy demand and emissions. The intensity of social interactions and learning plays an equally important role for the uptake of green technologies as economic considerations, and therefore in addition to carbon-price policies (top-down approach), implementing policies on education, social and cultural practices can significantly reduce residential carbon emissions.

AB We combine the velocity alignment and aggregation mechanisms to study the collective motion of active agents in noisy circumstances. The agents are located on a two-dimensional square plane, and the proportion of velocity alignment and aggregation interactions are, respectively, set to be k and 1 - k. In the case of k = 1 our model is similar to the classical Vicsek model, while it degenerates to the view angle model for k = 0. By tuning the intensity of the external noise eta and the proportional coefficient k, and carrying out extensive numerical simulations, we find that the system can exhibit diverse dynamic patterns widely observed in real biological systems. By means of finite-size scaling analysis, we confirm that the presence of the aggregation interaction affects not only the position of the critical noise eta(c) (beyond which the agents display disordered motion) but also the type of the phase transition of the collective motion. In particular, under a weak external noise environment, the transition from disordered to ordered state by increasing k (i.e., by decreasing the proportion of aggregation interaction) is found to be of first order. Besides, for moderate external noise, we also find the existence of the optimal proportion of the aggregation interaction for the system to achieve the highest degree of order. Our results highlights the important role of the aggregation interaction in the collective motion and may have promising potential applications in natural self-propelled particles and artificial multiagent systems.

AB Understanding and quantifying polarization in social systems is important because of many reasons. It could for instance help to avoid segregation and conflicts in the society or to control polarized debates and predict their outcomes. In this paper, we present a version of the q-voter model of opinion dynamics with two types of responses to social influence: conformity (like in the original q-voter model) and anticonformity. We put the model on a social network with the double-clique topology in order to check how the interplay between those responses impacts the opinion dynamics in a population divided into two antagonistic segments. The model is analyzed analytically, numerically and by means of Monte Carlo simulations. Our results show that the system undergoes two bifurcations as the number of cross-links between cliques changes. Below the first critical point, consensus in the entire system is possible. Thus, two antagonistic cliques may share the same opinion only if they are loosely connected. Above that point, the system ends up in a polarized state.

AB There is growing interest in creating empirically grounded agent based models (ABMs) to simulate land use change at a variety of spatio-temporal scales. The development of land use change models is challenging, as there is a need to connect representations of human behavioural processes to simulations of the biophysical environment. This paper presents a new agent-based modelling framework (Aporia) that has the goal of reducing the complexity and difficulty of constructing high-fidelity land use models. Building on earlier conceptual developments for modelling land use change and the provision of ecosystem services, Aporia was designed to be modular, flexible and open, using a declarative, compositional approach to create complex models from subcomponents. The framework can be tightly or loosely coupled with multiple vegetation models, it can be set up to evaluate a range of ecosystem service indicators, and it can be calibrated for a range of different landscape-scale case studies and modelling styles. The framework is released under an Open Source licence, and can be freely re-used and modified to form the basis of new models. We illustrate this with two case studies implemented using Aporia, exploring different socio-economic scenarios and behavioural characteristics on the land use decisions of Swiss and Scottish farmers. We also discuss the benefits of frameworks in terms of their flexibility, expandability, verification and transparency. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The media plays an important role in the process of opinion evolution. It can promote the spread of opinions and make netizens reach consensus towards the specific topic. To study the critical role of the media in the evolution of opinions, we constructed a mathematical model of opinion dynamics under the influence of the media. Through mathematical analysis, we can get analytical solutions which are individuals' opinion values in the equilibrium and interval of the convergence time. We also employed an online network topology from a real social platform for numerical simulation to verify the theoretical solutions. It found that the participation of the media greatly accelerated the dissemination of opinions. The supporting proportion for the media's opinion is ramped up quickly when intervention time of the media reaches a certain value which we thought this time as best intervention time. When network size is larger, agents will be more negative in equilibrium. Even intervention time is longer, agents still cannot support the media. With extreme initial opinions and self-confidence of all agents, we found that the media can better influence fully stubborn agents than flexible agents. At the same time, the media can better change flexible agents positions than stubborn agents. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: To apply clarithromycin as an immunomodulatory treatment in experimental infection caused by pan-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae.
   Methods: Acute pyelonephritis was induced in 80 rabbits after inoculation of the test isolate in the renal pelvis. Rabbits were divided into eight groups, with 10 animals in each group. In groups A-D, therapy was administered simultaneously with bacterial challenge as follows: A, controls; B, intravenous clarithromycin; C, amikacin; and D, both agents. In groups E-H, therapy was administered 24 h after bacterial challenge as follows: E, controls; F, intravenous clarithromycin; G, amikacin; and H, both agents. Blood was sampled for estimation of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and malondialdehyde (MDA); monocytes were isolated for determination of intracellular activity of caspase-3 and ex vivo TNF-alpha secretion. Four days after bacterial challenge, animals were sacrificed for quantitative cultures and biopsies of organs.
   Results: Serum TNF-alpha at 48 h was lower in groups B, C and D compared with group A. Activity of caspase-3 of monocytes was lower at 48 h in group D compared with group A. Bacterial loads of liver and spleen were decreased in group D compared with those of group A. The numbers of inflammatory cells of spleen of group B were lower compared with those of group A; those of kidney and mesenteric lymph nodes of group D were lower than those of group A. Serum MDA of group H was lower than that of group E and serum TNF-alpha of group F was lower compared with that of group E. TNF-alpha of monocyte supernatants and activity of caspase-3 of monocytes of group F were lower than those of group E. Bacterial tissue loads did not differ among groups E, F, G and H. The numbers of inflammatory cells of liver of groups F and H were lower compared with those of group E; those of kidney of groups F, G and H were lower compared with those of group E.
   Conclusions: Clarithromycin administered intravenously in experimental infection caused by pan-resistant K. pneumoniae attenuated systemic inflammatory response and local tissue damage. This effect is probably attributed to immunomodulatory intervention on blood monocytes.

AB This paper studies a model of coordinated influence in a social network in which several members, called players, can jointly affect the opinions of other members, called agents, during a finite period of time. The model is treated as a cooperative dynamic game. The influence of players is expressed by declaring their opinions which are then considered and weighted by the agents to form their own opinions. The goal is to find the declared opinions of players focusing only on associated costs as well as on the average deviation of agents beliefs from the desired ones. Under coordination, the total costs of players are distributed using the Shapley value. If there is no information about the degrees of trust of agents to each other, these degrees are estimated using a centrality measure. Numerical simulation is performed for a well-known social network of a university karate club and for a lattice graph often used for modeling of spatial networks.

AB How can minority cultures resist assimilation into a global monolith in an increasingly "small world"? Paradoxically, Axelrod found that local convergence can actually preserve global diversity if cultural influence is combined with homophily, the principle that "likes attract." However, follow-up studies showed that this diversity collapses under random cultural perturbation. The authors discovered a new source of this fragility-the assumption in Axelrod's model that cultural influence is interpersonal (dyadic). The authors replicated previous models but with the more empirically plausible assumption that influence is social-people can be simultaneously influenced by several network neighbors. Computational experiments show that cultural diversity then becomes much more robust than in Axelrod's original model or in published variations that included either social influence or homophily but not both. The authors conclude that global diversity may be sustained not by cultural experimentation and innovation but by the ability of cultural groups to discourage those activities.

AB This paper investigates how local preferences and social structural constraints might affect the development of the friendship network in Facebook. We do this by analyzing a dataset of an American university, Caltech, and by building an agent-based simulation for comparison. Several different, but plausible, processes of friendship network development are proposed in which the structural information of the growing network and the student preferences are taken into account. 'Network formation based on personal preference and social structure' matches the data best, and is thus the preferred hypothesis for the way that students add "friends" on Facebook.

AB In this paper we investigate the degree to which two social influences, namely imitation and coordinated consumption, effectuate inequalities in the motion picture industry. We develop an agent-based model based on micro movie visitors' decision-making that generates the observed macro market outcomes. The simulation model makes use of the findings of an empirical survey amongst 1112 cinema visitors. We find that social influences explain market inequalities and that the impact of coordinated consumption on market inequalities is stronger than the impact of imitation.

AB Experimental results have shown that the kinetics of bond formation in chemical crosslinking of gelatin solutions is strongly affected not only by gelatin and reactant concentrations but also by the solution pH. We present an extended numerical investigation of the phase diagram and of the kinetics of bond formation as a function of the pH, via Monte Carlo simulations of a lattice model for gelatin chains and reactant agent in solution. We find that gelation can be hindered either by loop formation, at low reactant concentrations, or by saturation of active sites of the chains via formation of single bonds with crosslinkers, at high reactant concentrations. The ratio of the characteristic times for the formation of first and the second bond between the crosslinker and an active site of a chain is found to depend on the reactant reactivity, in good agreement with experimental data.

AB A trifunctional epoxy resin (TGPAP) with excellent thermal stability was cured by several novel curing agents through a facile and cost-effective approach. The temperature of maximum weight loss rate (T-peak) of cured TGPAP were up to 370 degrees C and 330 degrees C under N-2 and air atmospheres, which attributed to the synergistic effects between curing agents and TGPAP. The dissipative particle dynamics simulations also reveal that the curing agents with more functional groups and higher reactivity induce the higher cross-linking density, leading to better mechanical properties. The simulations well reproduced the experimental results and also predicted the effect of the curing agents on mechanical properties.

AB Purpose: While extent of tumor resection is an important predictor of outcome in glioma, margin delineation remains challenging due to lack of inherent contrast between tumor and normal parenchyma. Fluorescence-guided surgery is promising for its ability to enhance contrast through exogenous fluorophores; however, the specificity and sensitivity of the underlying contrast mechanism and tumor delivery and uptake vary widely across approved and emerging agents.
   Experimental Design: Rats with orthotopic F98 wild-type and F98 EGFR-positive (EGFR(+)) gliomas received in vivo administration of IRDye680RD, 5-aminioleuvulinic acid, and ABY-029-markers of perfusion, protoporphyrin metabolism, and EGFR expression, respectively. Ex vivo imaging demonstrates the contrast mechanism-dependent spatial heterogeneity and enables within-animal comparisons of tumor-to-background ratio (TBR).
   Results: Generally, ABY-029 outperformed PpIX in F98(EGFR) orthotopic tumor margins and core (50% and 60% higher TBR, respectively). PpIX outperformed ABY-029 in F98(wt) margins by 60% but provided equivalent contrast in the bulk tumor. IRDye680RD provided little contrast, having an average TBR of 1.7 +/- 0.2. The unique spatial patterns of each agent were combined into a single metric, the multimechanistic fluorescence-contrast index (MFCI). ABY-029 performed best in EGFR(+) tumors (91% accuracy), while PpIX performed best in wild-type tumors (87% accuracy). Across all groups, ABY-029 and PpIX performed similarly (80% and 84%, respectively) but MFCI was 91% accurate, supporting multiagent imaging when tumor genotype was unknown.
   Conclusions: Human use of ABY-029 for glioma resection should enhance excision of EGFR(+) tumors and could be incorporated into current PpIX strategies to further enhance treatment in the general glioma case. (C) 2016 AACR.

AB Background: Biological mass transport processes determine the behavior and function of cells, regulate interactions between synthetic agents and recipient targets, and are key elements in the design and use of biosensors. Accurately predicting the outcomes of such processes is crucial to both enhancing our understanding of how these systems function, enabling the design of effective strategies to control their function, and verifying that engineered solutions perform according to plan.
   Methods: A Galerkin-based finite element model was developed and implemented to solve a system of two coupled partial differential equations governing biomolecule transport and reaction in live cells. The simulator was coupled, in the framework of an inverse modeling strategy, with an optimization algorithm and an experimental time series, obtained by the Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching ( FRAP) technique, to estimate biomolecule mass transport and reaction rate parameters. In the inverse algorithm, an adaptive method was implemented to calculate sensitivity matrix. A multi-criteria termination rule was developed to stop the inverse code at the solution. The applicability of the model was illustrated by simulating the mobility and binding of GFP-tagged glucocorticoid receptor in the nucleoplasm of mouse adenocarcinoma.
   Results: The numerical simulator shows excellent agreement with the analytic solutions and experimental FRAP data. Detailed residual analysis indicates that residuals have zero mean and constant variance and are normally distributed and uncorrelated. Therefore, the necessary and sufficient criteria for least square parameter optimization, which was used in this study, were met.
   Conclusion: The developed strategy is an efficient approach to extract as much physiochemical information from the FRAP protocol as possible. Well-posedness analysis of the inverse problem, however, indicates that the FRAP protocol provides insufficient information for unique simultaneous estimation of diffusion coefficient and binding rate parameters. Care should be exercised in drawing inferences, from FRAP data, regarding concentrations of free and bound proteins, average binding and diffusion times, and protein mobility unless they are confirmed by long-range Markov Chain-Monte Carlo ( MCMC) methods and experimental observations.

AB Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a widely used morphological imaging modality. Various contrast agents, which change localized optical properties, are used to extend the applicability of OCT, where intrinsic contrast is not sufficient. In this paper we propose the use of a dual-rod gold nano-structure as a polarization sensitive contrast agent. Using numerical simulation, we demonstrated that the proposed structure has tunable chiral response. Enhanced cross-section due to Plasmon resonance in gold nanoparticles, along with the chiral behavior can provide enhanced detection sensitivity. The proposed contrast agents may extend the applicability of OCT to the problems that require the molecular contrast with enhanced sensitivity. (C) 2011 Optical Society of America

AB The design of complex social systems, such as online communities, requires the consideration of many parameters, a practice at odds with social science research that focuses on the effects of a small set of variables. In this article, we show how synthesizing insights from multiple, narrowly focused social science theories in an agent-based model helps us understand factors that lead to the success of online communities. The agent-based model combines insights from theories related to collective effort, information overload, social identity, and interpersonal attraction to predict motivations for online community participation. We conducted virtual experiments to develop hypotheses around three design decisions about how to orchestrate an online community-topical breadth, message volume, and discussion moderation-and the trade-offs involved in making these decisions. The simulation experiments suggest that broad topics and high message volume can lead to higher member commitment. Personalized moderation outperforms other types of moderation in increasing members' commitment and contribution, especially in topically broad communities and those with high message volume. In comparison, community-level moderation increases commitment but not contribution, and only in topically narrow communities. These simulation results suggest a critical trade-off between informational and relational benefits. This research illustrates that there are many interactions among the design decisions that are important to consider; the particulars of the community's goals often determine the effectiveness of some decisions. It also demonstrates the value of agent-based modeling in synthesizing simple social science theories to describe and prescribe behaviors in a complex system, generating novel insights that inform the design of online communities.

AB Individuals vary in their propensity to use social learning, the engine of cultural evolution, to acquire information about their environment. The causes of those differences, however, remain largely unclear. Using an agent-based model, we tested the hypothesis that as a result of reproductive skew differences in energetic requirements for reproduction affect the value of social information. We found that social learning is associated with lower variance in yield and is more likely to evolve in risk-averse low-skew populations than in high-skew populations. Reproductive skew may also result in sex differences in social information use, as empirical data suggest that females are often more risk-averse than males. To explore how risk may affect sex differences in learning strategies, we simulated learning in sexually reproducing populations where one sex experiences more reproductive skew than the other. When both sexes compete for the same resources, they tend to adopt extreme strategies: the sex with greater reproductive skew approaches pure individual learning and the other approaches pure social learning. These results provide insight into the conditions that promote individual and species level variation in social learning and so may affect cultural evolution.

AB Objectives: Using agent-based modeling (ABM) within a complexity theory framework provides an alternative and promising method for significantly advancing the study of social good. Complexity theory is a systems approach based on the idea that aggregate patterns arise from the interactions of agents and their environments. Such systems operate according to a set of simple rules, and patterns emerge from these simple interactions that sometimes cannot be predicted by examining those interactions alone. ABM is a computational approach that simulates the interactions of autonomous agents with each other and their environments (social and/or physical). Methods: We adapted the Rebellion model from the NetLogo software library to demonstrate the potential of this approach to measure social good. Specifically, we examine the impact of variables related to juvenile justice involvement on the converse of social good, social exclusion, which in this model was conceptualized as the lack of educational attainment among youth at risk of juvenile justice involvement. After designing our ABM, we ran a total of 2400 simulations where we systematically varied key variables, including arrest risk and maximum sentence. Results: We report the descriptive statistics from our simulations for key output variables in the ABM, including percent socially excluded and average accumulated jail time, and demonstrate the usefulness of this method by identifying nonlinear, bivariate associations across the simulations. Conclusion: Our model demonstrates the usefulness of an innovative methodological approach, complexity theory, coupled with an innovative technology, ABM, in developing policies and programs that will maximize social good.

AB We combined keto-oxime chemistry with cyanide potentiometry to build an electrochemical oxime-based organophosphate (OP) sensor. The sensor is based on a specific chemical reaction, and high chemical selectivity is demonstrated by the testing with the potential interferents. Low concentrations (ppm or lower) of acetic anhydride, a good OP chemical warfare agent simulant, and malathion, an OP pesticide, show a fast potential response of tens of mV or larger. The experimental conditions for the oxime-based electrochemical sensor are optimized in terms of the chemical structure of oxime and the solution pH. (c) 2006 The Electrochemical Society.

AB Purpose Edema, if not reduced, can limit functional ability and cause pain and discomfort. Thus, this study aimed to determine whether electrical stimulation can reduce abdominal edema in rats. Methods Rats were anesthetized with 0.9 mL of iohexol, which is a radiopaque agent that was injected into their abdomens. This contrast agent was used as a marker to enable the observation of its re-absorption time in the presence of an applied electrical current. Contrast agent spreading was monitored through radiographies every 30 min, which started at time 0 (T-0) and lasted for 90 min (T-90). Duration a session that lasted for 1 h, the amplitude of the stimulatory pulse was adjusted to 90% of the animals' motor threshold, with a frequency of 120 Hz, and a 12.8-mu s pulse. Results Edema reduction was not statistically significant at T-0 (p = 0.515), T-30 (p = 0.460), and T-60 (p = 0.237) compared to the test and control groups; although, greater edema spreading was observed in the treated group at time T-90 (p = 0.055). However, a statistically relevant difference occurred when the time intervals within the same group were compared (p < 0.001). This means that the spreading of the contrast agent occurred owing to a reduction in the intensity in the inspected area. Conclusion High-voltage electrical stimulation (HVES) reduced simulated edema in the abdominal cavity of rats in the test group compared to that in the control group during the 90-min evaluation time, primarily during the last 30 min.

AB The nucleation-growth model has been used extensively for characterizing in vitro amyloid fibril formation kinetics and for simulating the relationship between amyloid and disease. In the majority of studies amyloid has been considered as the dominant, or sole, aggregation end product, with the presence of other competing non-amyloid aggregation processes, for example amorphous aggregate formation, being largely ignored. Here, we examine possible regulatory effects that off-pathway processes might exert on the rate and extent of amyloid formation - in particular their potential for providing false positives and negatives in the evaluation of anti-amyloidogenic agents. Furthermore, we investigate how such competing reactions might influence the standard interpretation of amyloid aggregation as a two-state system. We conclude by discussing our findings in terms of the general concepts of supersaturation and system metastability - providing some mechanistic insight as to how these empirical phenomena may manifest themselves in the amyloid arena.

   Diffusion of innovations
AB The dynamics of adoption of innovations is an important subject in many fields and areas, like technological development, industrial processes, social behavior, fashion or marketing. The number of adopters of a new technology generally increases following a kind of logistic function. However, empirical data provide evidences that this behavior may be more complex, as many factors influence the decision to adopt an innovation. On the one hand, although some individuals are inclined to adopt an innovation if many people do the same, there are others who act in the opposite direction, trying to differentiate from the "herd". People who prefer to behave like the others are called mimetic, whereas individuals who resist adopting new products, the stronger the greater the number of adopters, are named contrarians. Besides, in the real world new adopters may have second thoughts and change their decisions accordingly. In this contribution we include this possibility by means of repentance, a feature which was absent in previous models. The model of adoption of an innovation has all the ingredients of a previous version, in which the agents decision to adopt depends on the appeal of the novelty, the inertia or resistance to adopt it, and the social interactions with other agents, but now agents can repent and turn back to the old technology. We present analytic calculations and numerical simulations to determine the conditions for the establishment of the new technology. The inclusion of repentance can modify the balance between the global incentive to adopt and the number of contrarians who prevent full adoption, generating a rich landscape of temporal evolution that includes cycles of adoption.

AB Teaching and learning are highly social activities. Seminal psychologists such as Vygotsky, Piaget, and Bandura have theorized that social interaction is a key mechanism in the process of learning and development. In particular, the benefits of peer interaction for learning and motivation in classrooms have been broadly demonstrated through empirical studies. Hence, it would be valuable if computer-based environments could support a mechanism for a peer interaction. Though no claim of peer equivalence is made, pedagogical agents as learning companions (PALs)-animated digital characters functioning to simulate human-peer-like interaction-might provide an opportunity to simulate such social interaction in computer-based learning. In this article we ground the instructional potential of PALs in several social-cognitive theories, including distributed cognition, social interaction, and Bandura's social-cognitive theory. We discuss how specific concepts of the theories might support various instructional functions of PALs, acknowledging concepts that PALs cannot address. Based on the theoretical perspectives, we suggest key constituents for designing PALs that in human-peer interactions have proven significant. Finally, we review the current status of PAL research with respect to these constituents and suggest where further empirical research is necessary.

AB We study the co-evolutionary emergence of fairness preferences in the form of other-regarding behavior and its effect on the origination of costly punishment behavior in public good games. Our approach closely combines empirical results from three experiments with an evolutionary simulation model. In this way, we try to fill a gap between the evolutionary theoretical literature on cooperation and punishment on the one hand and the empirical findings from experimental economics on the other hand. As a principal result, we show that the evolution among interacting agents inevitably favors a sense for fairness in the form of :disadvantageous inequity aversion". The evolutionary dominance and stability of disadvantageous inequity aversion is demonstrated by enabling agents to co-evolve with different self-and other-regarding preferences in a competitive environment with limited resources. Disadvantageous inequity aversion leads to the emergence of costly ("altruistic") punishment behavior and quantitatively explains the level of punishment observed in contemporary lab experiments performed on subjects with a western culture. Our findings corroborate, complement, and interlink the experimental and theoretical literature that has shown the importance of other-regarding behavior in various decision settings.

DE minority game; evolution; critical point
AB Based on the general adiabatic theory for the evolutionary minority game (EMG) that we proposed earlier,(1) we perform a detail analysis of the EMG limited to three groups of agents. We derive a formula for the critical point of the transition from segregation (into opposing groups) to clustering (towards cautious behaviors). Particular to the three-group EMG, the strategy switching in the "extreme" group does not occur at every losing step and is strongly intermittent. This leads to an correction to the critical value of the number of agents at the transition, N-c. Our expression for Nc is in agreement with the results obtained from our numerical simulations.

AB Despite numerous technology advances, bioreactors are still mostly utilized as functional black-boxes where trial and error eventually leads to the desirable cellular outcome. Investigators have applied various computational approaches to understand the impact the internal dynamics of such devices has on overall cell growth, but such models cannot provide a comprehensive perspective regarding the system dynamics, due to limitations inherent to the underlying approaches. In this study, a novel multi-paradigm modeling platform capable of simulating the dynamic bidirectional relationship between cells and their microenvironment is presented. Designing the modeling platform entailed combining and coupling fully an agent-based modeling platform with a transport phenomena computational modeling framework. To demonstrate capability, the platform was used to study the impact of bioreactor parameters on the overall cell population behavior and vice versa. In order to achieve this, virtual bioreactors were constructed and seeded. The virtual cells, guided by a set of rules involving the simulated mass transport inside the bioreactor, as well as cell-related probabilistic parameters, were capable of displaying an array of behaviors such as proliferation, migration, chemotaxis and apoptosis. In this way the platform was shown to capture not only the impact of bioreactor transport processes on cellular behavior but also the influence that cellular activity wields on that very same local mass transport, thereby influencing overall cell growth. The platform was validated by simulating cellular chemotaxis in a virtual direct visualization chamber and comparing the simulation with its experimental analogue. The results presented in this paper are in agreement with published models of similar flavor. The modeling platform can be used as a concept selection tool to optimize bioreactor design specifications.

AB Flocks of birds and schools of fish are familiar examples of spatial patterns formed by living organisms. In contrast to the patterns on the skins of, say, zebras and giraffes, the patterns of our interest are transient although different patterns change over different timescales. The aesthetic beauty of these patterns has attracted the attention of poets and philosophers for centuries. Scientists front various disciplines, however, are in search of common underlying principles that give rise to the transient patterns in colonies of organisms. Such patterns are observed not only in colonies of organisms as simple as single-cell bacteria, but also in social insects like ants and termites. They are also observed in colonies of vertebrates as complex as birds and fish, and in human societies. In recent years, physicists have utilized the framework of statistical physics to understand these patterns. In this article, we present an overview emphasizing the common trends that rely on theoretical modeling of these systems using the so-called agent-based Lagrangian approach.

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Objective The aim of this study is to assess network-based weight loss interventions in the Chinese setting using agent-based simulation. Methods An agent-based model incorporating social, environmental and personal influence is developed to simulate the obesity epidemic through an interconnected social network among a population of 2197 individuals from the nationally representative survey. Model parameters are collected from literature and existing database. To ensure the robustness of our findings, the model is validated against empirical observations and sensitivity analyses are performed on calibrated parameters. Results When compared with the baseline model, significant weight difference is detected using paired samples t tests for network-based intervention strategies (p<0.05) but no difference is observed for the two conventional intervention strategies including choosing random or high-risk individuals (p>0.05). Targeting the most connected individuals minimizes the average population weight, average BMI, and generates a reduction of 2.70% and 1.38% in overweight and obesity prevalence. Conclusions The simulations shows that targeting individuals on the basis of their social network attributes outperforms conventional targeting strategies. Future work needs to focus on how to further leverage social networks to curb obesity prevalence and enhance interventions for other chronic conditions using agent-based simulation.

AB Artificial society simulations may provide unprecedented insight into the intricate dynamics of economic markets. Such an insight may help solve the well-known black-box dilemma of business simulations, where designers prefer model concealment over model transparency. The core contribution of this work is an agent-based business simulation that models the marketplace as an artificial society of consumers. In the simulation, users assume the role of a store owner playing against an artificial intelligence competitor. The simulation can be accessed via a graphical user interface that animates the decision behavior of consumers. Consumers are modeled as agents with concrete beliefs, intentions and desires that act to maximize their utility and accomplish their purchase plans. We claim that unlike the classical equation-based approach, the visualization of market dynamics facilitated by our agent-based approach can provide important information to the user. We hypothesize that such information is key to understanding several economic concepts. To validate our hypothesis, we conducted an experiment with 30 users, where we compared the effects of the graphical animation of the market. Our results indicate that the agent-based approach has better learning outcomes both at the level of users' subjective self-assessment and at the level of objective performance metrics and knowledge acquisition tests. As a secondary contribution, we demonstrate by example how simple codification rules at the level of the utility functions of agents allow the emergence of diverse macroeconomic behavior of a two-product duopoly.

AB Objectives: This study aims to evaluate the efficiency of experimental materials for the internal bleaching of non-vital teeth, compared to commercially available agents based on peroxides.
   Methods: Sixty extracted teeth divided in six groups underwent endodontic treatment followed by simulated discoloration. For each group, a different bleaching formulation was used. The dental colour was assessed by spectrophotometry.
   Results: According to the spectrophotometric analysis, the most effective results were achieved for groups treated with TiO2/SiO2/Aa and TiO2/SiO2 with small amount of sodium perborate addition.
   Conclusions: Our study reveals that internal bleaching with oxidative systems is a plausible innovation.

AB Cooperation in modern society is based on mutual trust and reputation information can well reflect people's social image. Good social norms encourage people to cooperate with high-reputation (or called 'good') individuals and severely punish those who defect 'good' individuals. However, the existing research lacks a unified criterion of how to evaluate the behavior when interacting with low-reputation (or called 'bad') people. Based on public goods games, we focus on exploring second-order social norms that can improve the evolution of cooperation in this study. Parameters to control the reward and punishment intensity through increasing or decreasing one's reputation when interacting with 'bad' individuals are introduced. Simulation results show that this reward and punishment mechanism through reputation can effectively promote the evolution of cooperation in both well-mixed and latticed populations. Under certain high-reputation threshold environments, a well-mixed population structure can even promote cooperation more significantly than a lattice network. However, increasing reward intensity for cooperating with 'bad' individuals cannot further improve cooperation, but in a high-reputation threshold environment, increasing punishment intensity for defecting 'bad' individuals can further improve cooperation. This research extends the use of statistical physics to study the evolution of cooperation from the perspective of reputation-based dynamics.

AB Networks offer a powerful language with which to describe and study pairwise interaction. However, in many contexts, these rich collective phenomena require a higher-order approach to encode dynamical processes - for example in idea integration and information transmission (co-publication is a particularly familiar example). Here we introduce a novel framework for social communication by reshaping the networked system to be a simplicial complex, where the communication involves the interaction not only of individual nodes but also among cliques to which they belong. Simplicial complexes extend the network-based pairwise relationship to multiagent interaction. Assuming that the same individual in different cliques may play different roles, a threshold is designed and combined with the node state to determine the clique state. We employ the discrete microscopic Markov chain approach to model the simplex-based social communication and then obtain the underlying critical condition for information outbreaks. Moreover, we perform extensive numerical analysis of the proposed simplicial complex-based communication model and compare its performance with Monte Carlo simulation. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB Empirical evidence has suggested that, facing different trading strategies and complicated decision, the proportions of agents relying on particular strategies may stay at constant level or vary over time. This paper presents a simple "dynamic market fraction" model of two groups of traders, fundamentalists and trend followers, under a market maker scenario. Market mood and evolutionary adaption are characterized by fixed and adaptive switching fraction among two groups, respectively. Using local stability and bifurcation analysis, as well as numerical simulation, the role played by the key parameters in the market behaviour is examined. Particular attention is paid to the impact of the market fraction, determined by the fixed proportions of confident fundamentalists and trend followers, and by the proportion of adaptively rational agents, who adopt different strategies over time depending on realized profits.

AB This paper studies bipartite consensus for first-order multiagent systems. To improve resource utilization, event-based protocols are considered for bipartite consensus. A new type of control gain is designed in the proposed protocols. By appropriate selection of control gains, the convergence rate of the closed-loop system can be adjusted. Firstly, for structural balance case, necessary and sufficient conditions are given on communication relations and consensus gains to achieve bipartite consensus. Secondly, for structural unbalance case, necessary and sufficient conditions are proposed to ensure the stabilizing of the system. It can be found that the system will not show Zeno behavior. Numerical simulations are used to demonstrate the theoretical results.

AB Agent-based modeling of artificial societies allows for the validation and analysis of human-interpretable, causal explanations of human behavior that generate society-scale phenomena. However, parameter calibration is insufficient to conduct data-driven explorations that are adequate in evaluating the importance of causal factors that constitute agent rules that match real-world individual-scale generative behaviors. We introduce evolutionary model discovery, a framework that combines genetic programming and random forest regression to evaluate the importance of a set of causal factors hypothesized to affect the individual's decision-making process. With evolutionary model discovery, we investigated the farm plot seeking behavior of the Ancestral Pueblo of the Long House Valley simulated in the Artificial Anasazi model. We evaluated the importance of causal factors unconsidered in the original model, which we hypothesized to have affected the decision-making process. Our findings, concur with other archaeological studies on the Ancestral Pueblo communities during the Pueblo II period, which indicate the existence of cross-village polities, hierarchical organization, and dependence on the viability of the agricultural niche. Contrary to the original Artificial Anasazi model, where closeness was the sole factor driving farm plot selection, selection of higher quality land, distancing from failed farm plots, and desire for social presence are found to be more important. Finally, models updated with farm selection strategies designed by incorporating these insights showed significant improvements in accuracy and robustness over the original Artificial Anasazi model.

AB Multi-organizational collaborative decision making in high-magnitude crisis situations requires real-time information sharing and dynamic modeling for effective response. Information technology (IT) based decision support tools can play a key role in facilitating such effective response. We explore one promising class of decision support tools based on machine learning, known as support vector machines (SVM), which have the capability to dynamically model and analyze decision processes. To examine this capability, we use a case study with a design science approach to evaluate improved decision-making effectiveness of an SVM algorithm in an agent-based simulation experimental environment. Testing and evaluation of real-time decision support tools in simulated environments provides an opportunity to assess their value under various dynamic conditions. Decision making in high-magnitude crisis situations involves multiple different patterns of behavior, requiring the development, application, and evaluation of different models. Therefore, we employ a multistage linear support vector machine (MLSVM) algorithm that permits partitioning decision maker response into behavioral subsets, which can then individually model and examine their diverse patterns of response behavior. The results of our case study indicate that our MLSVM is clearly superior to both single stage SVMs and traditional approaches such as linear and quadratic discriminant analysis for understanding and predicting behavior. We conclude that machine learning algorithms show promise for quickly assessing response strategy behavior and for providing the capability to share information with decision makers in multi-organizational collaborative environments, thus supporting more effective decision making in such contexts.

AB Fashion plays such a crucial rule in the evolution of culture and society that it is regarded as a second nature to the human being. Also, its impact on economy is quite nontrivial. On what is fashionable, interestingly, there are two viewpoints that are both extremely widespread but almost opposite: conformists think that what is popular is fashionable, while rebels believe that being different is the essence. Fashion color is fashionable in the first sense, and Lady Gaga in the second. We investigate a model where the population consists of the afore-mentioned two groups of people that are located on social networks (a spatial cellular automata network and small-world networks). This model captures two fundamental kinds of social interactions (coordination and anti-coordination) simultaneously, and also has its own interest to game theory: it is a hybrid model of pure competition and pure cooperation. This is true because when a conformist meets a rebel, they play the zero sum matching pennies game, which is pure competition. When two conformists (rebels) meet, they play the (anti-) coordination game, which is pure cooperation. Simulation shows that simple social interactions greatly promote cooperation: in most cases people can reach an extraordinarily high level of cooperation, through a selfish, myopic, naive, and local interacting dynamic (the best response dynamic). We find that degree of synchronization also plays a critical role, but mostly on the negative side. Four indices, namely cooperation degree, average satisfaction degree, equilibrium ratio and complete ratio, are defined and applied to measure people's cooperation levels from various angles. Phase transition, as well as emergence of many interesting geographic patterns in the cellular automata network, is also observed.

AB Effective procedures associated with storage and disposal of chemical warfare (CW) agents are important for the protection of civilian populations from inadvertent release of these agents. Emergency groups as well as citizens in surrounding communities need to know the relative effectiveness of various chemical protective clothing (CPC) ensembles in the unlikely event of such releases. A method has been developed for studying permeation of chemical warfare agent simulants through CPC materials. The experimental results characterize some commercially available CPC materials. Thirteen different CPC materials having widely differing compositions were chosen to study the permeation of four different liquid CW simulants (dimethyl methyl phosphonate, diisopropyl methyl phosphonate, malathion, and dibutyl sulfide) through these CPC materials at 25-degrees-C. This permeation study involved a newly developed analytical technique employing room temperature fluorescence quenching of an indicator compound, phenanthrene, on filter paper. Various experimental factors such as breakthrough time, rate of permeation and uptake were investigated. On the basis of breakthrough time, the 13 CPC materials could be divided into three groups: most resistant, moderately resistant, and least resistant. Materials in the most resistant category exhibited no permeation by any of the simulants for at least 24 hours. Breakthrough occurred in the least resistant materials in generally less than an hour, and sometimes as soon as a few minutes.

AB This paper presents scalable traffic stability analysis for both pure connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) traffic and mixed traffic based on continuum traffic flow models. Human-drive vehicles (HDVs) are modeled by a non-equilibrium traffic flow model, i.e., Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) to capture HDV traffic's unstable nature. CAVs are modeled by a mean field game describing their non-cooperative behaviors as rational utility-optimizing agents. Working with continuum models helps avoiding scalabillty issues in microscopic multi-class traffic models. We demonstrate from linear stability analysis that the mean field game traffic flow model behaves differently from traditional traffic flow models and stability can only be proved when the total density is in a certain regime. We also show from numerical experiments that CAVs help stabilize mixed traffic. Further, we quantify the impact of CAV's penetration rate and controller design on traffic stability. The results may provide qualitative insights on traffic stability in mixed-autonomy for human drivers and city planners. The results also provide suggestions on CAV controller design for CAV manufacturers.

AB Recent studies suggest that human emotions diffuse in not only real-world communities but also online social media. However, a comprehensive model that considers up-todate findings and multiple online social media mechanisms is still missing. To bridge this vital gap, an agent-based model, which concurrently considers emotion influence and tie strength preferences, is presented to simulate the emotion contagion and competition. Our model well reproduces patterns observed in the empirical data, like anger's preference on weak ties, anger-dominated users' high vitalities and angry tweets' short retweet intervals, and anger's competitiveness in negative events. The comparison with a previously presented baseline model further demonstrates its effectiveness in modeling online emotion contagion. It is also surprisingly revealed by our model that as the ratio of anger approaches joy with a gap less than 12%, anger will eventually dominate the online social media and arrives the collective outrage in the cyber space. The critical gap disclosed here can be indeed warning signals at early stages for outrage control. Our model would shed lights on the study of multiple issues regarding emotion contagion and competition in terms of computer simulations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The analysis of origin airports in multi-airport regions has a well established tradition in transportation and regional economics. The main goal of the paper is to estimate the importance of the different attributes that determine origin airport choice. In our case we adopt a stated preference approach to study this problem and evaluate the effects of possible policy interventions. We also perform a detailed segmentation of the sample studied according to the socio-economic variables that prove statistically relevant when interacted with the attributes used to characterise airport choice. Moreover, in order to test for the presence of heterogeneity in agents' preferences we estimate several mixed logit models with different specifications, including heteroscedasticity and error component. With respect to previous studies we develop and extend the traditional SP approach by also analysing the role and relevance of attribute cut-offs in this research field. The policy simulations produced are based on the estimation of airport-specific attributes. The study concentrates on a multi-airport region in central Italy where four competing airports are located. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper draws on the metaphor of a spectrum of models ranging from the most theory-driven to the most evidence-driven. The issue of concern is the practice and criteria that will be appro- priate to validation of different models. In order to address this concern, two modelling approaches are investigated in some detailed - one from each end of our metaphorical spectrum. Windrum et al. (2007) (http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/10/2/8.html) claimed strong similarities between agent based social simulation and conventional social science - specifically econometric - approaches to empirical modelling and on that basis considered how econometric validation techniques might be used in empirical social simulations more broadly. An alternative, the approach of the French school of 'companion modelling' associated with Bousquet, Barreteau, Le Page and others, engages stakeholders in the modelling and validation process. The conventional approach is constrained by prior theory and the French school approach by evidence. In this sense they are at opposite ends of the theory-evidence spectrum. The problems for validation identified by Windrum et al. are shown to be irrelevant to companion modelling which readily incorporates complexity due to realistically descriptive specifications of individual behaviour and social interaction. The result combines the precision of formal approaches with the richness of narrative scenarios. Companion modelling is therefore found to be practicable and to achieve what is claimed for it and this alone is a key difference from conventional social science including agent based computational economics.

   modelling framework; Three-level architecture
AB As complex adaptive systems(CAS) continue to grow in scale and complexity, and the need for system adaptability increases, systems modelling has become an essential concern. Parallel discrete event simulation became a preferred choice as logical process world view, which bridges complex system modelling and high-performance computing. To resolve the shortcoming of this world view identified with respect to modularity and scalability. A hierarchical composite modelling framework was proposed, which is a three-level architecture intended to support the composition and integration of sub-models. The bottom layer is simulation model component(SMC), which is not a model but implement some simulation-specific support functionality. The middle layer is logical process model(LP), which describes an agent which can react to the current situation by executing a sequence of SMCs. The top layer is CAS system model, which defines a CAS model consist of several LPs and also the interactions between these LPs. The hierarchical composite modelling process and parallel simulation execution strategy are discussed to support the modelling and simulation of a CAS. In order to verify its effectiveness, a complex social opinion system model is proposed based on this hierarchical composite modelling framework. The experimental results confirms the viability of utilizing multi-level architecture for simulating large scale complex adaptive systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID PATTERNS
AB In this paper, we propose a data-driven agent-based modeling approach that boosts the strength of agent-based models (ABM) in the dynamics of family formation. The proposed model analyzes the impact of socioeconomic factors on individual decisions about family formations. The key features of our model are the heterogeneous nature regarding agent's age and socioeconomic factors: income and education. Based on these attributes, agents take decisions about acceptable partners and transition to family formation. One of our objectives is to fill the gap that exists between the methodologies of demography and agent-based social simulation. Making such a connection between these two approaches, this model attempts to incorporate empirical data into agent-based social simulation which enables us to analyze the transition of family formation effectively. Further, our simulated results depict the patterns of the hazards of family formation that are observed at micro-level dynamics and explains how marriage patterns change overtime. The proposed work gives a strong insight to strengthen the extent of demographic analysis through data-driven agent-based approach.

AB Public goods games played by a group of individuals collectively performing actions towards a common interest characterize social dilemmas where both competition and cooperation are present. By using agent-based simulation, this paper investigates how collective action in the form of repeated n-person linear public goods games is affected when the interaction of individuals is driven by the underlying hierarchical structure of an organization. The proposed agent-based simulation model is based on generally known empirical findings about public goods games and takes into account that individuals may change their profiles from conditional cooperators to rational egoists or vice versa. To do so, a fuzzy logic system was designed to allow the cumulative modification of agents' profiles in the presence of vague variables such as individuals' attitude towards group pressure and/or their perception about the cooperation of others. From the simulation results, it can be concluded that collective action is affected by the structural characteristics of hierarchical organizations. The major findings are as follows: (1) Cooperation in organizational structures is fostered when there is a collegial model defining the structure of the punishment mechanisms employed by organizations. (2) Having multiple, and small organizational units fosters group pressure and highlights the positive perception about the cooperation of others, resulting in organizations achieving relatively high aggregate contribution levels. (3) The greater the number of levels, the higher the aggregate contribution level of an organization when effective sanctioning systems are introduced.

AB The increasing capabilities of conversational agents (CAs) offer manifold opportunities to assist users in a variety of tasks. In an organizational context, particularly their potential to simulate a human-like interaction via natural language currently attracts attention both at the customer interface as well as for internal purposes, often in the form of chatbots. Emerging experimental studies on CAs look into the impact of anthropomorphic design elements, so-called social cues, on user perception. However, while these studies provide valuable prescriptive knowledge of selected social cues, they neglect the potential detrimental influence of the limited responsiveness of present-day conversational agents. In practice, many CAs fail to continuously provide meaningful responses in a conversation due to the open nature of natural language interaction, which negatively influences user perception and often led to CAs being discontinued in the past. Thus, designing a CA that provides a human-like interaction experience while minimizing the risks associated with limited conversational capabilities represents a substantial design problem. This study addresses the aforementioned problem by proposing and evaluating a design for a CA that offers a human-like interaction experience while mitigating negative effects due to limited responsiveness. Through the presentation of the artifact and the synthesis of prescriptive knowledge in the form of a nascent design theory for anthropomorphic enterprise CAs, this research adds to the growing knowledge base for designing human-like assistants and supports practitioners seeking to introduce them into their organizations.

AB With the development of artificial intelligence, multiagent algorithms have been applied to many real-time strategy games. Making plans on the human being is gradually passing away, especially in combat scenarios. Cognitive electronic warfare (CEW) is a complex and challenging work due to the sensitivity of the data sources. There are few studies on CEW. In the past, wargame simulations depended on differential equations and war theory, which resulted in high time and human resource costs. In the future, as other artificial intelligence theories are developed, artificial intelligence will play a more critical role in wargames. The capabilities of multiagent modeling to describe complex systems and predict actions in dynamic environments are superior to those of traditional methods. In this paper, we use a 3D wargame engine from China Aerospace System Simulation Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing) named All Domain Simulation (ACS), which supports land, sea, and air combat scenarios, to simulate combat. In the simulations, there are several unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) as attackers and several radar stations as defenders, and both have the ability to detect the others. In the game, several UAVs need to learn to detect targets and track targets separately, and we train the UAV's behavior by well-designed reward shaping and multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) with LSTM. We improved the RDPG algorithm and merged the MADDPG and RDPG algorithms. From the experimental results, we can see that the effectiveness and accuracy of the algorithm have been greatly improved.

AB Fire-prone landscapes are not well studied as coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) and present many challenges for understanding and promoting adaptive behaviors and institutions. Here, we explore how heterogeneity, feedbacks, and external drivers in this type of natural hazard system can lead to complexity and can limit the development of more adaptive approaches to policy and management. Institutions and social networks can counter these limitations and promote adaptation. We also develop a conceptual model that includes a robust characterization of social subsystems for a fire-prone landscape in Oregon and describe how we are building an agent-based model to promote understanding of this social-ecological system. Our agent-based model, which incorporates existing ecological models of vegetation and fire and is based on empirical studies of landowner decision-making, will be used to explore alternative management and fire scenarios with land managers and various public entities. We expect that the development of CHANS frameworks and the application of a simulation model in a collaborative setting will facilitate the development of more effective policies and practices for fire-prone landscapes.

AB A network of brain structures including hippocampus (HC), prefrontal cortex, and striatum controls goal-directed behavior and decision making. However, the neural mechanisms underlying these functions are unknown. Here, we review the role of 'internally generated sequences': structured, multi-neuron firing patterns in the network that are not confined to signaling the current state or location of an agent, but are generated on the basis of internal brain dynamics. Neurophysiological studies suggest that such sequences fulfill functions in memory consolidation, augmentation of representations, internal simulation, and recombination of acquired information. Using computational modeling, we propose that internally generated sequences may be productively considered a component of goal-directed decision systems, implementing a sampling-based inference engine that optimizes goal acquisition at multiple timescales of on-line choice, action control, and learning.

AB In this paper, we develop a conceptual framework for an anthropomorphic change agent to motivate pre-service teachers to integrate technology into teaching and learning. This agent is designed with a hybrid persona that simulates a mentor and plays both motivation and companion roles. Based on the theoretical grounding in motivation and change agency and related research, we propose that a computer-based change agent will impact pre-service teachers' attitudes toward technology integration and improve their abilities to be effective users of educational technology. The impact on learning and instruction is explained as a process of changing perceptions and concerns about the value of using technology to support their learning. We build on models of innovation-decision processes and attributes of adoption of innovation and concern-based adoption. Practical considerations for the design of a virtual change agent are provided with respect to appearance, voice and emotional expression. Further research is also discussed, especially regard to empirical validation of specific components of the framework and longitudinal studies of teacher attitudes.

AB The "social intelligence hypothesis" states that the need to cope with complexities of social life has driven the evolution of advanced cognitive abilities. It is usually invoked in the context of challenges arising from complex intragroup structures, hierarchies, and alliances. However, a fundamental aspect of group living remains largely unexplored as a driving force in cognitive evolution: the competition between individuals searching for resources (producers) and conspecifics that parasitize their findings (scroungers). In populations of social foragers, abilities that enable scroungers to steal by outsmarting producers, and those allowing producers to prevent theft by outsmarting scroungers, are likely to be beneficial and may fuel a cognitive arms race. Using analytical theory and agent-based simulations, we present a general model for such a race that is driven by the producer-scrounger game and show that the race's plausibility is dramatically affected by the nature of the evolving abilities. If scrounging and scrounging avoidance rely on separate, strategy-specific cognitive abilities, arms races are short-lived and have a limited effect on cognition. However, general cognitive abilities that facilitate both scrounging and scrounging avoidance undergo stable, long-lasting arms races. Thus, ubiquitous foraging interactions may lead to the evolution of general cognitive abilities in social animals, without the requirement of complex intragroup structures.

AB This article offers a new perspective on sociological theory, based on psychological insights from Perceptual Control Theory. After describing this cybernetic model of goal-directed behavior and reviewing its empirical support, I present results from computer simulations applying the model to the social interactions of elementary control agents. My key finding is that agents controlling their own perceptions of a single environmental variable can stabilize it even when their intentions conflict. The concluding section discusses implications of this model of collective control processes for the sources of order, conflict, continuity, and change in social life. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB An effective approach is developed to investigate potential complexing agents in Zn-Ni bath by using density functional theory (DFT), molecular dynamic (MD) simulations and electrochemical experiments. Pyrophosphate is predicted as the most promising auxiliary complexing agent in introduced DMH based bath compared with other complexing agents owing to its weaker adsorption capacity. The DFT calculations show that the most possible and stable structures for zinc (II) and nickel (II) in the electrolyte are the complexes that with one pyrophosphate and two 5-5'-diethylhydantoins (DMH) as the complexing agents. The electrodeposition mechanism of Zn-Ni alloys in selected DMH-pyrophosphate electrolyte was studied by electrochemical measurements. The effects of Zn content, Ni content and bath temperature in the bath on CV curves were also investigated. The rate controlling rate is determined based on Koutecky-Levich equation and a mixed controlled process is observed. The nucleation mechanism of Zn-Ni alloys is a 3D instantaneous nucleation and the bath temperature has no effect on the nucleation of Zn-Ni alloys. The combined theoretical and experimental tests indicate that pyrophosphate is an excellent auxiliary complexing agent in DMH-based Zn-Ni bath and can also provide an efficient method to study or design complexing agents for other metal electroplating.

AB This paper examines the dynamic impact of matching on economic mobility and growth. To account for complex interactions over time, experimental economies of heterogeneous agents are simulated with the match process acting as a fitness selection mechanism. Even with perfect information and substantial variety in both offspring and entrants, two-sided matching inevitably causes the population to evolve into stratified groups. Corrective measures are possible to improve mobility, but by altering the path of market evolution, a policy may have unintended impacts on growth and inequality. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, a high-intensity ultrasonic liquid processor was used to obtain a homogeneous mixture of epoxy resin and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The CNTs were infused into epon 862 epoxy resin through sonic cavitation and then mixed with W curing agent using a high-speed mechanical agitator. The trapped air and reaction volatiles were removed from the mixture using a high vacuum. Flexural tests and fracture toughness tests were performed on unfilled and CNT-filled epoxy to identify the effect of adding CNTs on the mechanical properties of epoxy. The highest improvement in strength and fracture toughness was obtained with 0.3 wt% CNT loading. The nanophased matrix filled with 0.3 wt% CNT was then used with weave carbon fabric in a vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) set up to fabricate composite panels. Flexural tests, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) were performed to evaluate the effectiveness of adding CNTs on the mechanical and thermal properties of the composite. The glass transition temperature, decomposition temperature, and flexural strengths were improved by infusing CNTs. Based on the experimental result, a linear damage model has been combined with the Weibull distribution function to establish a constitutive equation for neat and nanophased carbon/epoxy. Simulated result show that that infusing CNTs increases Weiubll scale parameter, but decrease Weibull shape parameter. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Social influence affects individual decision-making on soil conservation. Understanding the emergent diffusion of collective conservation effort is relevant to natural resource management at the river basin level. This study focuses on the effect of subjective norms and collective action on the diffusion of Soil Conservation Effort (SCE) in the Lake Naivasha basin (Kenya) for the period 1965-2010. A geographically-explicit Agent-Based Model (ABM) version of the CONSUMAT model was developed: the CONSERVAT model. In our model, we have represented heterogeneity in the physical environment and in the social network using empirical data. To parameterize the model, physical data, and social data from a household survey (n=307) were used. Model simulation results show that it is possible to reproduce empirical spatiotemporal diffusion patterns of SCE levels which are quite sensitive to the way in which social survey data are used to initialize the model. Overall, this study demonstrates (i) that social survey data can effectively be used for parameterization of a geographically-explicit ABM, and (ii) that empirical knowledge on natural environment characteristics and social phenomena can be used to build an agent-based model at the river basin level. This study is an important first step towards including subjective norms for evaluating the effectiveness of alternative policy strategies for natural resource management.

AB Although the role of social networks and consumer interactions in new product diffusion is widely acknowledged, such networks and interactions are often unobservable to researchers. What may be observable, instead, are aggregate diffusion patterns for past products adopted within a particular social network. The authors propose an approach for identifying systematic conditions that are stable across diffusions and thus are "transferrable" to new product introductions within a given network. Using Facebook applications data, the authors show that incorporation of such systematic conditions improves prelaunch forecasts. This research bridges the gap between the disciplines of Bayesian statistics and agent-based modeling by demonstrating how researchers can use stochastic relationships simulated within complex systems as meaningful inputs for Bayesian inference models.

AB Virtual reality (VR) brings radical new possibilities to the empirical study of social music cognition and interaction. In the present article, we consider the role of VR as a research tool, based on its potential to create a sense of "social presence": the illusory feeling of being, and socially interacting, inside a virtual environment. This makes VR promising for bridging ecological validity ("research in the wild") and experimental control ("research in the lab") in empirical music research. A critical assumption however is the actual ability of VR to simulate real-life social interactions, either via human-embodied avatars or computer-controlled agents. The mediation of social musical interactions via VR is particularly challenging due to their embodied, complex, and emotionally delicate nature. In this article, we introduce a methodological framework to operationalize social presence by a combination of factors across interrelated layers, relating to the performance output, embodied co-regulation, and subjective experiences. This framework provides the basis for the proposal of a pragmatic approach to determine the level of social presence in virtual musical interactions, by comparing the outcomes across the multiple layers with the outcomes of corresponding real-life musical interactions. We applied and tested this pragmatic approach via a case-study of piano duet performances of the piece Piano Phase composed by Steve Reich. This case-study indicated that a piano duet performed in VR, in which the real-time interaction between pianists is mediated by embodied avatars, might lead to a strong feeling of social presence, as reflected in the measures of performance output, embodied co-regulation, and subjective experience. In contrast, although a piano duet in VR between an actual pianist and a computer-controlled agent led to a relatively successful performance output, it was inadequate in terms of both embodied co-regulation and subjective experience.

AB The increase in readily available computational power raises the possibility that direct agent-based modeling can play a key role in the analysis of epidemiological population dynamics. Specifically, the objective of this work is to develop a robust agent-based computational framework to investigate the emergent structure of Susceptible-Infected-Removed/Recovered (SIR)-type populations and variants thereof, on a global planetary scale. To accomplish this objective, we develop a planet-wide model based on interaction between discrete entities (agents), where each agent on the surface of the planet is initially uninfected. Infections are then seeded on the planet in localized regions. Contracting an infection depends on the characteristics of each agent-i.e. their susceptibility and contact with the seeded, infected agents. Agent mobility on the planet is dictated by social policies, for example such as "shelter in place", "complete lockdown", etc. The global population is then allowed to evolve according to infected states of agents, over many time periods, leading to an SIR population. The work illustrates the construction of the computational framework and the relatively straightforward application with direct, non-phenomenological, input data. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the model construction and the results of such an approach.

AB In this paper, chromatographic analysis of active substance olopatadine hydrochloride, which is used in eye drops as antihistaminic agent, and its impurity E isomer by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) and application of design of experiments (DoE) methodology are presented. In addition, benzalkonium chloride is very often used as a preservative in eye drops. Therefore, the evaluation of its chromatographic behavior in HILIC was carried out as well. In order to estimate chromatographic behavior and set optimal chromatographic conditions, DoE methodology was applied. After the selection of important chromatographic factors, Box-Behnken design was utilized, and on the basis of the obtained models factor effects were examined. Then, multi-objective robust optimization is performed aiming to obtain chromatographic conditions that comply with several quality criteria simultaneously: adequate and robust separation of critical peak pair and maximum retention of the first eluting peak. The optimal conditions are identified by using grid point search methodology. The experimental verification confirmed the adequacy of the defined optimal conditions. Finally, under optimal chromatographic conditions, the method was validated and applicability of the proposed method was confirmed.

AB I analyze the survival probabilities of different types of agents in a general equilibrium model with disagreement over idiosyncratic uncertainties. I find that such biases create a separation between individual and group level survival: even when the survival probability of a single irrational agent tends to zero, these agents may still succeed as a whole. Effectively the irrational agent population can survive due to a vanishingly small group of increasingly rich agents. Disagreement over idiosyncratic uncertainties distorts savings decisions and interest rates, but idiosyncratic risks are not priced. Simulations confirm that the limiting results are relevant when the population of irrational agents is large. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A mobile robot is an autonomous agent, capable of planning the path from source to destination in both, a known, or an unknown environment. In this paper, we presented a novel approach to find the optimal trajectory. We have hybridized oppositional-based learning (OBL) with the evolutionary invasive weed optimization (IWO) technique to generate the optimal path for different robot(s). The navigation algorithm considered in this work is intelligent enough to fulfill the objective of minimizing the path length and the time to reach its specified goal. Oppositional IWO (OIWO) algorithm mimics the colonizing behavior of weed and uses the concept of quasi-opposite number, the concept of OBL is to find the shortest path between source and destination of mobile robot(s). An objective function has been formulated that takes care of the optimal target-seeking behavior as well as the obstacle avoidance of the mobile robot. In this technique, OBL considers the current population generated by IWO algorithm and its opposite population simultaneously to get better and faster convergence. The simulation and experimental results prove and validate the effectiveness of developed OIWO path planning algorithm.

AB For business applications of agent-based modeling and simulation, we should formulate rules for individual agents that are more realistic than those required by the KISS principle. This idea could be referred to as "empirical agent-based modeling." In order to develop such models, the first step could possibly be to apply well-established behavioral modeling to individuals/organizations and then link them incorporating interactions between those agents. As an illustrative work, we will present the modeling of TV viewing behavior including interactions in each family, each demographic segment and each reference group.

AB In this article, a symbolic version of the Simmel effect has been explored via computer simulation. The Simmel effect refers to the dynamics of status symbols in hierarchically ordered societies. This phenomenon was highlighted by the sociologist Georg Simmel, when he attempted to explain the rapid diffusion and decline of fashion. Simmel hypothesized that the instability of fashion results from the combined action of imitation of higher status members and distinction from those belonging to lower statuses. To test Simmel's hypothesis, the authors implemented a simulation model: the symbolic Simmel model (SySM), wherein a set of artificial agents hierarchically ordered apply in different combination the rules of imitation and distinction in the common task of sharing symbols. The findings support the view that the Simmel condition allows for a variable or unstable fate of symbols: The success of status symbols starts to decline as soon as they become dominant.

ID STATISTICAL PHYSICS
AB In this work, we study a simple model of social contagion that aims to represent the dynamics of social influences among politicians in an artificial corrupt parliament. We consider an agent-based model with three distinct types of artificial individuals (deputies), namely honest deputies, corrupt deputies and inflexible corrupt deputies. These last agents are committed to corruption, and they never change their state. The other two classes of agents are susceptible deputies, that can change state due to social pressure of other agents. We analyze the dynamic and stationary properties of the model as functions of the frozen density of inflexible corrupt individuals and two other parameters related to the strength of the social influences. We show that the honest individuals can disappear in the steady state, and such disappearance is related to an active-absorbing nonequilibrium phase transition that appears to be in the directed percolation universality class. We also determine the conditions leading to the survival of honesty in the long-time evolution of the system, and the regions of parameters for which the honest deputies can be the either the majority or the minority in the artificial parliament.

AB A multi-mechanism, three-dimensional, material model that captures the cyclic training and subsequent two-way shape memory behaviors of high-temperature ternary NiTiPd material is presented. To this end, available experimental test data on this alloy have been used for characterization of the model parameters and the subsequent validation of its predictions. Numerical simulations involving many thermal cycles and stress levels are used to investigate some of the key factors which influence the magnitude and stability of TWSM actuation strains. In particular, the developed model is used to provide quantitative measurements of the internal stresses induced in the NiTiPd SMA material after cyclic training, and how they predominantly affect the behavior of the material under zero-load TWSME. This is further substantiated by a detailed analysis of the global bending response of a trained beam strip, where emphasis is placed on the interplay between the two major agents responsible for the resulting TWSME actuation rotations: (1) intrinsic internal state variables, reflecting the microstructural changes occurring at the material point during thermal cycling, and (2) the extrinsic global residual state resulting from the inhomogeneous stress fields at different points over the section of the trained beam upon release of the training loads.

AB We model long rod-like molecules, such as DNA and coiled-coil proteins, as one-dimensional continua with a multi-well stored energy function. These molecules suffer a structural change in response to large forces, characterized by highly typical force-extension behavior. We assume that the structural change proceeds via a moving folded/unfolded interface, or phase boundary, that represents a jump in strain and is governed by the Abeyaratne-Knowles theory of phase transitions. We solve the governing equations using a finite difference method with moving nodes to represent phase boundaries. Our model can reproduce the experimental observations on the overstretching transition in DNA and coiled-coils and makes predictions for the speed at which the interface moves. We employ different types of kinetic relations to describe the mobility of the interface and show that this leads to different classes of experimentally observed force-extension curves. We make connections with several existing theories, experiments and simulation studies, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of the phase transitions-based approach in a biological setting.

AB Background and objective The number of fluctuations in skin conductance per second has been shown to correlate with postoperative pain. In this context, the effects of cholinesterase inhibitors and anticholinergic drugs used for the reversal of muscle relaxants were investigated.
   Methods Muscle relaxant effects were reversed in 30 patients with neostigmine and glycopyrrolate. No reversal agents were given to 30 controls. Patients' level of pain was quantified using a numeric rating scale (0-10) at several time points in the recovery room. The number of fluctuations in skin conductance per second was measured simultaneously.
   Results The number of fluctuations in skin conductance per second was significantly higher in patients with no and severe pain in the control compared with the reversal group (no pain 0.19 vs. 0.12; severe pain 0.40 vs. 0.19). The number of fluctuations in skin conductance per second was less sensitive to identify time points with moderate/severe pain in the reversal group.

AB Introduction: Administration of aminoglycoside (AG) antibiotics is one of the most common causes of ototoxicity. This study aimed to determine the protective effects of deferoxamine, an iron-chelating agent, on vestibulotoxicity using an intratympanic gentamicin injection (ITGM)-induced bilateral vestibulopathy rat model.
   Methods: Fifteen Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to the ITGM only (n = 5), the ITGM combined with intramuscular deferoxamine (DFO) injection (ITGM+DFO, n = 5), or the intratympanic normal saline (control, n = 5) group. The rats in the ITGM+DFO group received intramuscular injection of 150 mg/kg of deferoxamine at 30, 90, and 150 min after the ITGM. The vestibular function was evaluated using the rotarod and open field test every 3 days after the injection until Day 16 when the rats were subjected to histological changes.
   Results: The rats in the ITGM only group began to show significantly impaired vestibular function 2 days after ITGM into both ears. In contrast, the vestibular function was maintained in the control and ITGM+DFO groups without a difference throughout the experiments. The rats in the ITGM only group showed a near-complete loss of the type I and II hair cells and a collapse of the sensory epithelium in both the saccule and utricle. In contrast, the rats in the ITGM+DFO and control groups showed a relatively well-preserved sensory epithelium including the hair cells, cilia, and otolith layer.
   Conclusion: This study provides experimental evidence for preventive effects of iron-chelating agents on AG-induced vestibulotoxicity. Simultaneous administration of iron-chelating agents may be considered when using ototoxic agents, especially in those considered to be vulnerable to toxic damage of the inner ear.

AB Estimating the independent effect of "place" on health outcomes has proven quite difficult. In this issue of the Journal, Auchincloss and Diez Roux contribute a lucid introduction to agent-based simulation models and argue that they may be a fruitful alternative to current approaches to the problem. Insofar as conceptual understanding must precede empirical investigation, this author agrees. Given the obvious shortcoming of pure simulations, the key benefit of agent-based models lies in their ability to alter our thinking and/or theory. Among other things, the approach permits analysts to model (i.e., conceptualize) system dynamics, more realistic social treatment effects, endogenous contexts, and a more congenial image of human behavior.

AB Asphalt pavement systems for concrete bridge decks must not only comply with requirements from traffic and environmental exposure but also provide protection of the concrete structures against corrosive attacks from water or deicing agents. These multifunctional expectations are major challenges not only from the material side but also from the experimental side as to the evaluation of the right test methods for assessing the mechanical behavior of the whole multi-layer pavement system. In this article, the results of a research project comparing different asphalt pavement systems for alpine regions are presented. These systems consist of hot rolled and mastic asphalt for wearing and protection layers placed on waterproofing systems with polymer bitumen sheets, liquid polymer, and mastic asphalt. The study revealed both the mechanical differences between the different systems and the weaknesses or strengths of different mechanical tests, clearly demonstrating that one has to be careful in interpreting seemingly contradictory results of different test methods. In particular, it was interesting to see that the rutting assessment for some systems differs between cyclic compression tests and rutting tests conducted with a model mobile load simulator.

AB We develop an agent-based model on a lattice to investigate territorial development motivated by markings such as graffiti, generalizing a previously-published model to account for K groups instead of two groups. We then analyze this model and present two novel variations. Our model assumes that agents' movement is a biased random walk away from rival groups' markings. All interactions between agents are indirect, mediated through the markings. We numerically demonstrate that in a system of three groups, the groups segregate in certain parameter regimes. Starting from the discrete model, we formally derive the continuum system of 2K convection-diffusion equations for our model. These equations exhibit cross-diffusion due to the avoidance of the rival groups' markings. Both through numerical simulations and through a linear stability analysis of the continuum system, we find that many of the same properties hold for the K-group model as for the two-group model. We then introduce two novel variations of the agent-based model, one corresponding to some groups being more timid than others, and the other corresponding to some groups being more threatening than others. These variations present different territorial patterns than those found in the original model. We derive corresponding systems of convection-diffusion equations for each of these variations, finding both numerically and through linear stability analysis that each variation exhibits a phase transition.

AB The experimental and numerical investigations of single drop in liquid/liquid extraction system have been reviewed with particular focus on experimental techniques and computational fluid dynamic simulation approaches. Comprehensive surveys of available experimental techniques and numerical approaches for single drop rising and falling were given. Subsequently, single drop mass transfer was also reviewed both experimentally and numerically. Additionally, single drop breakage and coalescence process and the influencing factors were summarized and compared, so as to establish sub-models for population balance model. Future directions on single drop mass transfer, drop breakage and coalescence were suggested. It is believed that the single drop is a powerful tool to assist extraction process design from lab-scale to pilot-scale.

ID STATISTICS; MODEL
AB We argue that when a social convergence mechanism exists and is strong enough, one should expect the emergence of a well-defined 'field', i.e. a slowly evolving, local quantity around which individual attributes fluctuate in a finite range. This condensation phenomenon is well illustrated by the Deffuant-Weisbuch opinion model for which we provide a natural extension to allow for spatial heterogeneities. We show analytically and numerically that the resulting dynamics of the emergent field is a noisy diffusion equation that has a slow dynamics. This random diffusion equation reproduces the long-ranged, logarithmic decrease of the correlation of spatial voting pat terns empirically found in Borghesi and Bouchaud (2010 Eur. Phys. J. B 75 395) and Borghesi el al (2012 PLoS One 7 e36289). Interestingly enough, we find that When the social cohesion mechanism becomes too weak, cultural cohesion breaks down completely. in the sense that the distribution of intentions/opinions becomes infinitely broad. No emerging field exists in this case. All these analytical findings are confirmed by numerical simulations of an agent-based model.

AB There are some empirical evidences indicating that there is a collective complex oscillatory pattern in the amount of demand for dental visit at society level. In order to find the source of the complex cyclic behavior, we develop an agent-based model of collective behavior of routine dental check-ups in a social network. Simulation results show that demand for routine dental check-ups can follow an oscillatory pattern and the pattern's characteristics are highly dependent upon the structure of the social network of potential patients, the population, and the number of effective contacts between individuals. Such a cyclic pattern has public health consequences for patients and economic consequences for providers. The amplitude of oscillations was analyzed under different scenarios and for different network topologies. This allows us to postulate a simulation-based theory for the likelihood observing and the magnitude of a cyclic demand. Results show in case of random networks, as the number of contacts increases, the oscillatory pattern reaches its maximum intensity, for any population size. In case of ringing lattice networks, the amplitude of oscillations reduces considerably, when compared to random networks, and the oscillation intensity is strongly dependent on population. The results for small world networks is a combination of random and ring lattice networks. In addition, the simulation results are compared to empirical data from Google Trends for oral health related search queries in different United States cities. The empirical data indicates an oscillatory behavior for the level of attention to dental and oral health care issues. Furthermore, the oscillation amplitude is correlated with town's population. The data fits the case of random networks when the number of effective contacts is about 4-5 for each person. These results suggest that our model can be used for a fraction of people deeply involved in Internet activities like Web-based social networks and Google search.

AB ObjectiveTo evaluate the efficiency of humic acid substances on removing micro-organisms from denture base materials.
   BackgroundOld denture wearer needs effective, easy-use and safe denture-cleaning material.
   Material and methodsSquare-shaped, heat-polymerised acrylic resin specimens (n=550) were prepared and divided into five groups (n=110 for each) corresponding to the microbial contamination (Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Contaminated specimens were randomly assigned to the application of five different denture-cleaning agents as follows (n=20 for each): Kloroben, Corsodyl, Steradent, Corega, experimental solution with humic acid. Ten specimens were assessed as an experimental control carried out simultaneously for the treatment groups for each micro-organism. It was divided into two groups: negative control and positive control (n=5 for each). All acrylic specimens were incubated 37 degrees C for 24h (for bacterial strains) and 37 degrees C for 48h (for yeast strains). After incubation period, all brain-heart infusion broths (BHI) which contain disinfectant acrylic specimens were cultured on 5% sheep blood agar (for bacteria) and Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) for yeast using loop. The numbers of colony-forming units per millilitre (CFU/ml) were calculated. The results were analysed by Mann-Whitney U-test and Kruskal-Wallis tests (p=0.05).
   ResultsCorsodyl and Kloroben completely eliminated the adherence of all investigated micro-organisms (100%) and showed the highest removal activity compared with other cleaning agents (p<0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between Corsodyl and Kloroben (p0.05), and there was no statistically significant difference between Corega, Steradent and experimental solution (p0.05).
   ConclusionHumic acid could be used as an alternative natural' solution for denture-cleaning agent.

AB Many detection and attribution and pattern scaling studies assume that the global climate response to multiple forcings is additive: that the response over the historical period is statistically indistinguishable from the sum of the responses to individual forcings. Here, we use the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) and National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate System Model (CCSM4) simulations from the CMIP5 archive to test this assumption for multi-year trends in global-average, annual-average temperature and precipitation at multiple timescales. We find that responses in models forced by pre-computed aerosol and ozone concentrations are generally additive across forcings. However, we demonstrate that there are significant nonlinearities in precipitation responses to different forcings in a configuration of the GISS model that interactively computes these concentrations from precursor emissions. We attribute these to differences in ozone forcing arising from interactions between forcing agents. Our results suggest that attribution to specific forcings may be complicated in a model with fully interactive chemistry and may provide motivation for other modeling groups to conduct further single-forcing experiments.

AB We build an agent-based model of incarceration based on the susceptible-infected-suspectible (SIS) model of infectious disease propagation. Our central hypothesis is that the observed racial disparities in incarceration rates between Black and White Americans can be explained as the result of differential sentencing between the two demographic groups. We demonstrate that if incarceration can be spread through a social influence network, then even relatively small differences in sentencing can result in large disparities in incarceration rates. Controlling for effects of transmissibility, susceptibility and influence network structure, our model reproduces the observed large disparities in incarceration rates given the differences in sentence lengths for White and Black drug offenders in the USA without extensive parameter tuning. We further establish the suitability of the SIS model as applied to incarceration by demonstrating that the observed structural patterns of recidivism are an emergent property of the model. In fact, our model shows a remarkably close correspondence with California incarceration data. This work advances efforts to combine the theories and methods of epidemiology and criminology.

AB Effective teamwork in an initially leaderless group requires a high level of collective leadership emerging from dynamic interactions among group members. Leader emergence is a crucial topic in collective leadership, yet it is challenging to investigate as the problem context is typically highly complex and dynamic. Here, we explore leadership emergence and leadership perception by means of computational simulations whose assumptions and parameters were informed by empirical research and human-subject experiments. Our agent-based model describes the process of group planning. Each agent is assigned with three key attributes: talkativeness, intelligence, and credibility. An agent can propose a suggestion to modify the group plan as a speaker or respond and evaluate others' suggestions and leadership as a listener. Simulation results suggested that agents with high values of talkativeness, intelligence, and credibility tended to be perceived as leaders by their peers. Results also showed that talkativeness may be the most significant and instantaneous predictor for leader emergence of the three investigated attributes: talkativeness, intelligence, and credibility. In terms of group performance, smaller groups may outperform larger groups regarding their problem-solving ability in the beginning, but their performance tends to be of no significant difference in a long run. These results match the empirical literature and offer a mechanistic, operationalized description of the collective leadership processes.

AB Analysing social networks is challenging. Key features of relational data require the use of non-standard statistical methods such as developing system-specific null, or reference, models that randomize one or more components of the observed data. Here we review a variety of randomization procedures that generate reference models for social network analysis. Reference models provide an expectation for hypothesis testing when analysing network data. We outline the key stages in producing an effective reference model and detail four approaches for generating reference distributions: permutation, resampling, sampling from a distribution, and generative models. We highlight when each type of approach would be appropriate and note potential pitfalls for researchers to avoid. Throughout, we illustrate our points with examples from a simulated social system. Our aim is to provide social network researchers with a deeper understanding of analytical approaches to enhance their confidence when tailoring reference models to specific research questions.

AB Social and economic systems consist of complex interactions among its members. Their behaviors become adaptive according to changing environment. In many cases, an individual's behaviors can be modeled by a stimulus-response system in a dynamic environment. In this paper, we use the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) game, which is a simple model to deal with complex problems for dynamic systems. We propose strategic coalition consisting of many agents and simulate their emergence in a co-evolutionary learning environment. Also we introduce the concept of confidence for agents in a coalition and show how such confidences help to improve the generalization ability of the whole coalition. Experimental results show that co-evolutionary learning with coalitions and confidence can produce better performing strategies that generalize well in dynamic environments.

AB The ecosystem service concept has emphasized the role of people within socio-ecological systems (SESs). In this paper, we review and discuss alternative ways of representing people, their behaviour and decision-making processes in SES models using an agent-based modelling (ABM) approach. We also explore how ABM can be empirically grounded using information from social survey. The capacity for ABM to be generalized beyond case studies represents a crucial next step in modelling SESs, although this comes with considerable intellectual challenges. We propose the notion of human functional types, as an analogy of plant functional types, to support the expansion (scaling) of ABM to larger areas. The expansion of scope also implies the need to represent institutional agents in SES models in order to account for alternative governance structures and policy feedbacks. Further development in the coupling of human-environment systems would contribute considerably to better application and use of the ecosystem service concept.

AB This article introduces an agent-based modeling laboratory for investigating how evolving hazard information, propagated through forecaster, media, public official, and peer information networks, affects patterns of public protective-action decisions during hurricane threats. The model, called CHIME ABM, provides a platform for integrating atmospheric science, social science, and computer and information science knowledge and data to explore the complex socio-ecological dynamics of modern hazard information and decision systems from a new perspective. First, the model's interdisciplinary conceptualization and implementation is described. Results are then presented from experiments demonstrating the model's behaviors and comparing patterns of evacuation decisions when key agent parameters and the geographical population distribution, forecast skill, and storm are varied. The article illustrates how this type of theoretically and empirically informed digital laboratory can be used to develop new insights into the interactions among environmental hazards, information flow, protective decisions, and societal outcomes.

AB Agent-Based Models are useful to describe and understand social, economic and spatial systems' dynamics. But, beside the facilities which this methodology offers, evaluation and comparison of simulation models are sometimes problematic. A rigorous conceptual frame needs to be developed. This is in order to ensure the coherence in the chain linking at the one extreme the scientist's hypotheses about the modeled phenomenon and at the other the structure of rules in the computer program. This also systematizes the model design from the the matician conceptual framework as well. The aim is to reflect upon the role that a well defined ontology, based on the crossing of the philosophical and the computer science insights, can play to solve such questions and help the model building. We analyze different conceptions of ontology, introduce the 'ontological test' and show its usefulness to compare models. Then we focus on the model building and show the place of a systematic ABM ontology. The latter process is situated within a larger framework called the 'knowledge framework' in which not only the ontologies but also the notions of theory, model and empirical data take place. At last the relation between emergence and ontology is discussed.

AB Recent experimental studies on Zr-IV-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have shown the extraordinary effectiveness of these porous materials for the detoxification of phosphorus-based chemical warfare agents (CWAs). However, pressing challenges remain with respect to characterizing these catalytic processes both at the molecular and crystalline levels. We here use theory to compare the reactivity of different zirconium-based MOFs for the catalytic hydrolysis of the CWA sarin, using both periodic and cluster modeling. We consider both hydrated and dehydrated secondary building units, as well as linker functionalized MOFs, to more fully understand and rationalize available experimental findings as well as to enable concrete predictions for achieving higher activities for the decomposition of CWAs.

AB The emergence of cooperation in wolf-pack hunting is studied using a simple, homogeneous, particle-based computational model. Wolves and prey are modelled as particles that interact through attractive and repulsive forces. Realistic patterns of wolf aggregation readily emerge in numerical simulations, even though the model includes no explicit wolf-wolf attractive forces, showing that the form of cooperation needed for wolf-pack hunting can take place even among strangers. Simulations are used to obtain the stationary states and equilibria of the wolves and prey system and to characterize their stability. Different geometric configurations for different pack sizes arise. In small packs, the stable configuration is a regular polygon centred on the prey, while in large packs, individual behavioural differentiation occurs and induces the emergence of complex behavioural patterns between privileged positions. Stable configurations of large wolf-packs include travelling and rotating formations, periodic oscillatory behaviours and chaotic group behaviours. These findings suggest a possible mechanism by which larger pack sizes can trigger collective behaviours that lead to the reduction and loss of group hunting effectiveness, thus explaining the observed tendency of hunting success to peak at small pack sizes. They also explain how seemingly complex collective behaviours can emerge from simple rules, among agents that need not have significant cognitive skills or social organization.

Recently, empirical approach to action perception has been facilitated by using well-controlled artificial stimuli, such as robots. One broad question this approach can address is what aspects of similarity between the observer and the observed agent facilitate motor simulation. Since humans have evolved among other humans and animals, using artificial stimuli such as robots allows us to probe whether our social perceptual systems are specifically tuned to process other biological entities. In this study, we used humanoid robots with different degrees of human-likeness in appearance and motion along with electromyography (EMG) to measure muscle activity in participants' arms while they either observed or imitated videos of three agents produce actions with their right arm. The agents were a Human (biological appearance and motion), a Robot (mechanical appearance and motion), and an Android (biological appearance and mechanical motion). Right arm muscle activity increased when participants imitated all agents. Increased muscle activation was found also in the stationary arm both during imitation and observation. Furthermore, muscle activity was sensitive to motion dynamics: activity was significantly stronger for imitation of the human than both mechanical agents. There was also a relationship between the dynamics of the muscle activity and motion dynamics in stimuli. Overall our data indicate that motor simulation is not limited to observation and imitation of agents with a biological appearance, but is also found for robots. However we also found sensitivity to human motion in the EMG responses. Combining data from multiple methods allows us to obtain a more complete picture of action understanding and the underlying neural computations.

ID STATISTICAL PHYSICS; CONSENSUS
AB While many opinion models often concentrate on the stable state and phase transition of the dynamics, the temporal evolution pattern of public opinion rarely is investigated. If the variation of opinions with time can be formulated, it is probable to effectively characterize the intrinsic process or even predict the future trend of the global state. In this paper, we study a trust-aware voter model in which individual trust co-evolves with their opinions and the trust on a target agent propagates from common neighbors. When agents often have similar opinions with their neighbors, they may develop trust on the neighbors, and vice versa. Individual trust changes opinion interactions, and agents tend to adopt opinions of the neighbors they trust. Mean-field analysis and simulations are conducted to explore the transient opinion profiles of the model. Results prove that public opinion changes as an exponential mixture form in both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. Most agents quickly stick to the majority opinion, and the conservation of magnetization is broken. Indirect trust promotes opinion interactions and drives the system towards consensus. In addition, we conduct empirical experiments on topic discussions of a real-world network, and the results show that. the model well fits and predicts opinion formation over online social networks.

TI An Agent-Based Model of Private Woodland Owner Management Behavior Using

SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID DECISION-MAKING; FOREST OWNERS; SIMULATION; LANDSCAPE; PROTOCOL; SYSTEMS
AB Privately owned woodlands are an important source of timber and ecosystem services in North America and worldwide. Impacts of management on these ecosystems and timber supply from these woodlands are difficult to estimate because complex behavioral theory informs the owner's management decisions. The decision-making environment consists of exogenous market factors, internal cognitive processes, and social interactions with fellow landowners, foresters, and other rural community members. This study seeks to understand how social interactions, information flow, and peer-to-peer networks influence timber harvesting behavior using an agent-based model. This theoretical model includes forested polygons in various states of 'harvest readiness' and three types of agents: forest landowners, foresters, and peer leaders (individuals trained in conservation who use peer-to-peer networking). Agent rules, interactions, and characteristics were parameterized with values from existing literature and an empirical survey of forest landowner attitudes, intentions, and demographics. The model demonstrates that as trust in foresters and peer leaders increases, the percentage of the forest that is harvested sustainably increases. Furthermore, peer leaders can serve to increase landowner trust in foresters. Model output and equations will inform forest policy and extension/outreach efforts. The model also serves as an important testing ground for new theories of landowner decision making and behavior.

AB Numerical simulations of a superfilling model are shown to be consistent with experimental results obtained in the absence of an inhibiting, leveling agent that can be described by a diffusion-adsorption mechanism. The model, which assumes that superfilling is caused by accumulation of the adsorbed accelerator at the feature bottom as surface area available for deposition within a feature shrinks, also predicts the formation of bumps. Because the model parameters have not been independently measured, the details of the model may need further refinement, but the general approach appears feasible.

TI Modeling Information Diffusion over Social Networks for Temporal Dynamic

DT Article
DE Information diffusion; social network; modeling; prediction
AB Modeling the process of information diffusion is a challenging problem. Although numerous attempts have been made in order to solve this problem, very few studies are actually able to simulate and predict temporal dynamics of the diffusion process. In this paper, we propose a novel information diffusion model, namely GT model, which treats the nodes of a network as intelligent and rational agents and then calculates their corresponding payoffs, given different choices to make strategic decisions. By introducing time-related payoffs based on the diffusion data, the proposed GT model can be used to predict whether or not the user's behaviors will occur in a specific time interval. The user's payoff can be divided into two parts: social payoff from the user's social contacts and preference payoff from the user's idiosyncratic preference. We here exploit the global influence of the user and the social influence between any two users to accurately calculate the social payoff. In addition, we develop a new method of presenting social influence that can fully capture the temporal dynamics of social influence. Experimental results from two different datasets, Sina Weibo and Flickr demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed prediction method with different evaluation metrics.

AB Collective motion is one of the most ubiquitous behaviours displayed by social organisms and has led to the development of numerous models. Recent advances in the understanding of sensory system and information processing by animals impels one to revise classical assumptions made in decisional algorithms. In this context, we present a model describing the three-dimensional visual sensory system of fish that adjust their trajectory according to their perception field. Furthermore, we introduce a stochastic process based on a probability distribution function to move in targeted directions rather than on a summation of influential vectors as is classically assumed by most models. In parallel, we present experimental results of zebrafish (alone or in group of 10) swimming in both homogeneous and heterogeneous environments. We use these experimental data to set the parameter values of our model and show that this perception-based approach can simulate the collective motion of species showing cohesive behaviour in heterogeneous environments. Finally, we discuss the advances of this multilayermodel and its possible outcomes in biological, physical and robotic sciences.

AB Humans are the only species to have evolved cooperative care-giving as a strategy for disease control. A synthesis of evidence from the fossil record, paleogenomics, human ecology, and disease transmission models, suggests that care-giving for the diseased evolved as part of the unique suite of cognitive and socio-cultural specializations that are attributed to the genus Homo. Here we demonstrate that the evolution of hominin social structure enabled the evolution of care-giving for the diseased. Using agent-based modeling, we simulate the evolution of care-giving in hominin networks derived from a basal primate social system and the three leading hypotheses of ancestral human social organization, each of which would have had to deal with the elevated disease spread associated with care-giving.We show that (1) care-giving is an evolutionarily stable strategy in kin-based cooperatively breeding groups, (2) care-giving can become established in small, low density groups, similar to communities that existed before the increases in community size and density that are associated with the advent of agriculture in the Neolithic, and (3) once established, care-giving became a successful method of disease control across social systems, even as community sizes and densities increased. We conclude that care-giving enabled hominins to suppress disease spread as social complexity, and thus socially-transmitted disease risk, increased.

AB A social approach can be exploited for the Internet of Things (IoT) to manage a large number of connected objects. These objects operate as autonomous agents to request and provide information and services to users. Establishing trustworthy relationships among the objects greatly improves the effectiveness of node interaction in the social IoT and helps nodes overcome perceptions of uncertainty and risk. However, there are limitations in the existing trust models. In this paper, a comprehensive model of trust is proposed that is tailored to the social IoT. The model includes ingredients such as trustor, trustee, goal, trustworthiness evaluation, decision, action, result, and context. Building on this trust model, we clarify the concepts of trust in the social IoT in five aspects such as: 1) mutuality of trustor and trustee; 2) inferential transfer of trust; 3) transitivity of trust; 4) trustworthiness update; and 5) trustworthiness affected by dynamic environment. With network connectivities that are from real-world social networks, a series of simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the social IoT operated with the proposed trust model. An experimental IoT network is used to further validate the proposed trust model.

AB This paper studies the issues of using mobile agents to achieve load sharing for network services in a wide-area network environment such as the Internet. Traditionally, load sharing algorithms are based on the message-passing paradigm. In this paper, we propose the use of mobile agents as an aid to design fully distributed and dynamic load-sharing mechanisms for wide-area network services, which provide several advantages over the pure message-passing-based approach. A framework (called MALS-mobile agent-enabled load-sharing) for structuring and designing load sharing in wide-area network services is presented. In particular, we describe the design of a mobile agent-enabled distributed dynamic load-sharing scheme within the MALS framework. A simulation environment of the load-sharing protocol is being implemented using Aglet(TM), a Java-compliant mobile agent platform front IBM. Preliminary experimental results demonstrated that the proposed framework is effective. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID TIME
AB The presence of burstiness in temporal social networks, revealed by a power-law form of the waiting time distribution of consecutive interactions, is expected to produce aging effects in the corresponding time-integrated network. Here, we propose an analytically tractable model, in which interactions among the agents are ruled by a renewal process, that is able to reproduce this aging behavior. We develop an analytic solution for the topological properties of the integrated network produced by the model, finding that the time translation invariance of the degree distribution is broken. We validate our predictions against numerical simulations, and we check for the presence of aging effects in a empirical temporal network, ruled by bursty social interactions.

AB Science content knowledge is essential for many applied practices within health-care professions. With this in mind, the current study seeks to promote in-depth conceptual understanding of science pharmacology content among students from health-care programs nursing, nutrition, and health education by introducing learning with agent-based models. While the literature shows that learning with agent-based models promotes better conceptual understanding than more traditional approaches, to achieve these potential benefits, instructional supports are needed. This study employed an experimental pre- and post-test design comparing two forms of instructional approaches for learning with agent-based models: one group learned with agent based models using the vicarious approach, where pairs observed and collaboratively discussed recordings of others' learning with agent-based models; the other group explored agent-based models in pairs while collaboratively discussing a set of text-based prompts, the guided exploration approach. The results revealed significantly higher pharmacology learning gains following the vicarious instructional approach compared with the guided exploration of agent based models. Thus, findings suggest that learning from observation can be comparable and even superior to the guided exploration approach with regard to the immediate knowledge gains when collaboratively dialoguing with a peer while observing dialogue of others takes place. Future research should evaluate this instructional effect on knowledge retention and with long-term interventions.

AB In this study, we present a selective overview of group and individual foraging behaviour and propose an agent-based model to unify these methodologies, enabling the exploration of plausible causal mechanisms and novel hypothesis generation. Despite its popular place in behavioural science, little work has been done with the generalized matching equation as it pertains to simulation work. Our model uses psychologically justifiable and theoretically grounded models of memory for time and decision rules. The results of preliminary simulation experiments suggest that the model is sensitive to changes in pay-off density and correctly replicates Ideal Free Distributions.

AB The rapid spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a global threat affecting almost all countries in the world. As countries reach the infection peak, it is planned to return to a new normal under different coexistence conditions in order to reduce the economic effects produced by the total or partial closure of companies, universities, shops, etc. Under such circumstances, the use of mathematical models to evaluate the transmission risk of COVID-19 in various facilities represents an important tool in assisting authorities to make informed decisions. On the other hand, agent-based modeling is a relatively new approach to model complex systems composed of agents whose behavior is described using simple rules. Different from classical mathematical models (which consider a homogenous population), agent-based approaches model individuals with distinct characteristics and provide more realistic results. In this paper, an agent-based model to evaluate the COVID-19 transmission risks in facilities is presented. The proposed scheme has been designed to simulate the spatiotemporal transmission process. In the model, simulated agents make decisions depending on the programmed rules. Such rules correspond to spatial patterns and infection conditions under which agents interact to characterize the transmission process. The model also includes an individual profile for each agent, which defines its main social characteristics and health conditions used during its interactions. In general, this profile partially determines the behavior of the agent during its interactions with other individuals. Several hypothetical scenarios have been considered to show the performance of the proposed model. Experimental results have demonstrated that the simulations provide useful information to produce strategies for reducing the transmission risks of COVID-19 within the facilities.

ID MULTIAGENT SYSTEMS; OBSERVABILITY
AB The controllability problem of heterogeneous interdependent group systems with undirected and directed topology is investigated in this paper. First, the interdependent model of the heterogeneous system is set up according to the difference of individual characteristics. An extended distributed protocol with the external sliding-mode control is designed, under which it is shown that a heterogeneous interdependent group system is controllable when the corresponding communication topology is controllable. Then, using the network eigenvalue method, the driving individuals are determined for a heterogeneous system with undirected topology. Under directed topology, the maximum match method is utilized to confirm the driving individuals. Some sufficient and necessary conditions are presented to assure that the heterogeneous interdependent group system is structurally controllable. Via theoretical analysis, the controllability of heterogeneous interdependent systems is related to the interdependent manner and the structure of the heterogeneous system. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

AB Aim To date, there is no safe, effective, and rapid method to eliminate the pain associated with needle insertion. It is noticed that using a low-energy laser before intradermal and intramuscular injection would help rapid local anaesthesia with a lidocaine product. However, there is no valuable data on the effect of the concomitant use of laser and benzocaine as a pretreatment option, compared to local application of benzocaine products alone before needle insertion.
   Materials and methods A prospective single-blind clinical trial was designed to assess pain perception during needle insertion into mucosa in 66-healthy volunteer dental students. They received a topical anaesthetic agent on one side (control) applied for one minute and a topical anaesthetic agent plus low power laser on the other side (experimental) prior to needle insertion. The first pre-treatment method was Chosen based on block randomisation table. A dentist recorded the Subjects' reaction based on the visual analogue scale (VAS) during insertion of needle in the two groups. SPSS version 15 was used for data analysis. The statistical significant level was defined at P-value<0.01.
   Result The mean scores of VAS for the experimental and control groups was 21 +/- and 19 +/- 2.70 respectively, with a statistically significant higher VAS Score in the experimental group, although it was not clinically significant.
   Conclusion Simultaneous application of laser with local anaesthetic products containing benzocaine in the buccal mucosa before dental needle insertion does not reduce pain perception.

AB The Swiss energy strategy aims at increasing electricity generation from solar power by 2050, to fulfil Switzerland's commitments in the Paris Agreement. However, the market of single- and two-family houses is characterized by low return rates for excess power injected to the grid, and the installation of rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) is sensitive to financial incentives. We assess the drivers influencing the diffusion of rooftop solar PV systems until 2050, by employing an agent-based model. An agent is a single-or two-family house, and its decision to invest depends on the economic profitability of the investment, the agent's income, environmental benefits (injunctive social norm), awareness and knowledge about the solar PV technology, and the impact of the social network (descriptive social norm). The model includes a synthetic population of agents, statistically equivalent to the true population. We also investigate the impact of different support policies, technology learning rates, electricity prices, and discount rates on the investment decision. We find that the concept of prosumer emerges, mainly via self-consumption strategies. The diffusion process of rooftop solar PV systems in single-and two-family houses gains momentum in the future. In the near-term, PV deployment is sensitive to the profitability of the investment, while after the year 2030, peer effects play an increasing role in the agents' investment decisions.

AB Objective: In addition to its role as a remineralizing agent in preventing dental caries, recent evidence has shown that casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) can protect teeth against erosion. The aim of this study was to determine whether CPP-ACP could reduce enamel wear rates under severe erosive conditions simulating heavy attrition and gastric regurgitation.
   Design: Enamel specimens were subjected to 10,000 wear cycles at a load of 100 N and pH 1.2 in a tooth wear machine. The machine was stopped every 2 min (160 cycles), and CPP-ACP in the form of a paste was applied for 5 min in experimental group 1. A paste with the same formulation but without CPP-ACP was applied in experimental group 2. No paste was applied in the control group.
   Results: A linear mixed model analysis indicated that the mean wear rates in experimental group 1 (0.44 +/- 0.05 mm(3) per 1000 cycles) and in experimental group 2 (0.63 +/- 0.06 mm(3) per 1000 cycles) were significantly lower than that in the control group (0.92 +/- 0.11 mm(3) per 1000 cycles) (p < 0.05). The mean wear rate in experimental group I was also lower than that in experimental group 2 (p < 0.05). Wear facets in experimental groups 1 and 2 were noted to be smoother and more polished than those in the control group.
   Conclusions: Both remineralizing and lubricating properties of the paste containing CPP-ACP appear to contribute to wear reduction in enamel. These findings may lead to new strategies for the clinical management of tooth wear. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Residential burglary s a social problem in every major urban area. As such, progress has been to develop quantitative, informative and applicable models for this type of crime: (1) the Deterministic-time-step (DTS) model [Short, D'Orsogna, Pasour, Tita, Brantingham, Bertozzi & Chayes (2008) Math. Models Methods Appl. Set 18, 1249-1267], a pioneering agent-based statistical model of residential burglary criminal behaviour, with deterministic time steps assumed for arrivals of events in which the residential burglary aggregate pattern formation is quantitatively studied for the first time; (2) the SSRB model (agent-based stochastic-statistical model of residential burglary crime) [Wang, Zhang, Bertozzi & Short (2019) Active Particles, Vol. 2, Springer Nature Switzerland AG, in press], in which the stochastic component of the model is theoretically analysed by introduction of a Poisson clock with time steps turned into exponentially distributed random variables. To incorporate independence of agents, in this work, five types of Poisson clocks are taken into consideration. Poisson clocks (I), (II) and (III) govern independent agent actions of burglary behaviour, and Poisson clocks (IV) and (V) govern interactions of agents with the environment. All the Poisson clocks are independent. The time increments are independently exponentially distributed, which are more suitable to model individual actions of agents. Applying the method of merging and splitting of Poisson processes, the independent Poisson clocks can be treated as one, making the analysis and simulation similar to the SSRB model. A Martingale formula is derived, which consists of a deterministic and a stochastic component. A scaling property of the Martingale formulation with varying burglar population is found, which provides a theory to the finite size effects. The theory is supported by quantitative numerical simulations using the pattern-formation quantifying statistics. Results presented here will be transformative for both elements of application and analysis of agent-based models for residential burglary or in other domains.

AB In this work, we employed a computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based model with a Eulerian multiphase approach to simulate the fluidization hydrodynamics in biomass gasification processes. Air was used as the gasifying/fluidizing agent and entered the gasifier at the bottom which subsequently fluidized the solid particles inside the reactor column. The momentum exchange related to the gas-phase was simulated by considering various viscous models (i.e., laminar and turbulence models of the re-normalisation group (RNG), k-epsilon and k-omega). The pressure drop gradient obtained by employing each viscous model was plotted for different superficial velocities and compared with the experimental data for validation. The turbulent model of RNG k- was found to best represent the actual process. We also studied the effect of air distributor plates with different pore diameters (2, 3 and 5 mm) on the momentum of the fluidizing fluid. The plate with 3-mm pores showed larger turbulent viscosities above the surface. The effects of drag models (Syamlal-O'Brien, Gidaspow and energy minimum multi-scale method (EMMS) on the bed's pressure drop as well as on the volume fractions of the solid particles were investigated. The Syamlal-O'Brien model was found to forecast bed pressure drops most consistently, with the pressure drops recorded throughout the experimental process. The formation of bubbles and their motion along the gasifier height in the presence of the turbulent flow was seen to follow a different pattern from with the laminar flow.

AB In word-of-mouth seeding programs, customer word of mouth can generate value through market expansion; in other words, it can gain customers who would not otherwise have bought the product. Alternatively, word of mouth can generate value by accelerating the purchases of customers who would have purchased anyway. This article presents the first investigation exploring how acceleration and expansion combine to generate value in a word-of-mouth seeding program for a new product. The authors define a program's "social value" as the global change, over the entire social system, in customer equity that can be attributed to the word-of-mouth program participants. They compute programs' social value in various scenarios using an agent-based simulation model and empirical connectivity data on 12 social networks in various markets as input to the simulation. The authors show how expansion and acceleration integrate to create programs' social value and illustrate how the role of each is affected by factors such as competition, program targeting, profit decline, and retention. These results have substantial implications for the design and evaluation of word-of-mouth marketing programs and of the profit impact of word of mouth in general.

AB We propose a simple swarm model to study collective behaviour of a group of mobile autonomous agents interacting through a long range attraction and short range repulsion function. It is shown that the individuals (agents) will aggregate and eventually form a cohesive cluster of finite size around the swarm centre in a finite time, and the size depends only on the parameters of the swarm model. Furthermore, it is also shown that all the individuals will converge to equilibrium positions of the swarm model, and thus the configuration of the swarm converges to a constant constellation. Numerical simulations are also worked out to illustrate the analytical results.

AB This paper presents an investigation about cooperation in a Public Good Game using an Agent Based Model calibrated on experimental data. Starting from the experiment proposed in Colasante and Russo (2016), we analyze the dynamic of cooperation in a Public Good Game where agents receive an heterogeneous income and choose both the level of contribution and the distribution rule. The starting point is the calibration and the output validation of the model using the experimental results. Once tested the goodness of fit of the Agent Based Model, we run some policy experiment in order to verify how each distribution rule, i.e. equidistribution, proportional to contribution and progressive, affects the level of contribution in the simulated model. We find out that the share of cooperators decreases over time if we exogenously set the equidistribution rule. On the contrary, the share of cooperators converges to 100% if we impose the progressive rule. Finally, the most interesting result refers to the effect of the progressive rule. We observe that, in the case of high inequality, this rule is not able to reduce the heterogeneity of income. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper considers a group of mobile autonomous agents moving in the space with point mass dynamics. We investigate the dynamic properties of the group for the case that the topology of the neighboring relations between agents varies with time. We introduce a set of switching control laws and show that the desired stable flocking motion can be achieved by using them. The control laws are a combination of attractive/repulsive and alignment forces, and the control law acting on each agent relies on the state information of its neighbors and the external reference signal. By using the control laws, all agent velocities asymptotically approach the desired velocity, collisions are avoided between the agents, and the final tight formation minimizes all agent potentials. Finally, numerical simulations are worked out to further illustrate our theoretical results.

AB In this paper we analyze the stochastic model proposed by Galam in [S. Galam, Modelling rumors: The no plane Pentagon French hoax case, Physica A 320 (2003), 571-580], for information spreading in a 'word-of-mouth' process among agents, based on a majority rule. Using the Communications rules among agents defined in the above reference, we first perform simulations of the 'word-of-mouth' process and compare the results with the theoretical values predicted by Galam's model. Some dissimilarities arise in particular when a small number of agents is considered. We find motivations for these dissimilarities and Suggest some enhancements by introducing a new parameter dependent model. We propose a modified Galam's scheme which is asymptotically coincident with the original model in the above reference. Furthermore, for relatively small values of the parameter, we provide a numerical experience proving that the modified model often outperforms the original one. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB Introduction: The treatment of hydatid disease is largely surgical, with medical treatment being reserved as coadjuvant treatment, The scolicidal agents have been,and are being used mainly during surgical manipulation of the cysts, with the object of avoiding relapses and peritoneal dissemination. Objective: Evaluation of the scolicidal agents used in surgery in a hydatid disease model in the mouse. Material and Methods: We have used 85 Swiss OF1 mice, weighing more than 30 g, of 90 +/- 10 days of age,in which a picture of hydatid sowing was reproduced by means of intra-peritoneal inoculation with 0.2 mi of a suspension which contained approximately 1,200 viable protoscolex of Echinococcus granulosus which came from the livers of parasite-infested sheep. 24 h after the inoculation, the mice were subjected to a median laparotomy for the introduction of 1 mi of the scolicidal solution to be evaluated: physiologic saline (n = 10); 10% povidone iodine (n = 15) praziquantel (n = 15); 10% hydrogen peroxide (n = 15) 10% hypertonic saline (a = 15); simulated operation (a = 15), After 7 months of follow-up, the mice were sacrificed and the following was evaluated: number of isolated cysts, cyst masses, and total cysts, Results: The number of isolated cysts which developed was significantly lower in the hydrogen peroxide group (tF 2.14 < RC 3.29). The number of cyst masses was significantly reduced in the hydrogen peroxide group (tF 2.14 < RC 2.18), in the povidone iodine group (tF 2.17 < RC 3), and in the hypertonic saline group (tF 2.11 < RC 2.77). The total number of cysts which developed decreased significantly in the hydrogen peroxide (tF 2.14 < RC 2.84) and the povidone iodine (tF 2.17 < RC 3.79) groups. Conclusions: Hydrogen peroxide and povidone iodine shaw a greater protoscolicidal effect than simple cleansing with physiological saline, hypertonic saline, or praziquantel.

AB This paper applies two experimental economics methods (i.e., agent-based modeling and laboratory experiment) to a market test suite that is based on a fictional European wholesale electricity market. Quantitative results of generators' strategic behavior in this market context are separated between generators played by human subjects (i.e., master students) in a laboratory experiment and generators represented by computational agents in an agent-based model. The behavior is measured through offers that students or agents make when participating in the electricity trading auction and the market outcomes under both methods are discussed in order to illustrate the difference between the behavior of human and computational agents. The paper also identifies the improvements that would need to be made to the market test suite to allow for a more conclusive comparison in future experiments.

AB Simultaneous vaccination against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae can decrease the efficacy of the separate vaccination. The aim of present research was to clarify whether immunization against M. hyopneumoniae only protects against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome development. The challenge test with both porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus and M. hyopneumoniae was performed in experimental conditions on Swine groups, with different immune protection against M. hyopneumoniae. The experiment was conducted Oil twenty specific pathogen free three-month-old piglets that previously acquired varying levels of protection against M. I Subcutaneous vaccination. The results suggest that M. hyopneumoniae initiates the pathogenic chain of M. hyopneumoniae - porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus co-infection. Simultaneously vaccinated via oral and parenteral routes animals demonstrated maximal scoring of M. hyopneumoniae lesions (5.0 against 2.0 in control group), therefore such strategy seems unreasonable.
   The immunization against M. hyopneumoniae undoubtedly influences the development of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus - M. hyopneumoniae co-infection. however, the interactions between infections agents and immune defense depend oil the qualitative and quantitative parameters of immunity. These interactions are multi-factorial and too complicated for an absolutely correct prognosis. The protection against M. hyopneumoniae disease development can prevent or, at least, delay porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome in piglets and vice versa: the lung lesions and immune suppression caused by M. hyopneumoniae can open the gate to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, which additionally complicates pathogenesis and leads to unfavorable consequences.

AB Streptococci are a group of Gram-positive bacteria which are responsible for causing many diverse diseases in humans and other animals worldwide. The high prevalence of resistance of these bacteria to current antibacterial drugs is an alarming problem for the scientific community. The battle against streptococci by using antimicrobial chemotherapies will depend on the design of new chemicals with high inhibitory activity, having also as low toxicity as possible. Multi-target approaches based on quantitative-structure activity relationships (mt-QSAR) have played a very important role, providing a better knowledge about the molecular patterns related with the appearance of different pharmacological profiles including antimicrobial activity. Until now, almost all mt-QSAR models have considered the study of biological activity or toxicity separately. In the present study, we develop by the first time, a unified multitasking (mtk) QSAR model for the simultaneous prediction of anti-streptococci activity and toxic effects against biological models like Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus. The mtk-QSAR model was created by using artificial neural networks (ANN) analysis for the classification of compounds as positive (high biological activity and/or low toxicity) or negative (otherwise) under diverse sets of experimental conditions. Our mtk-QSAR model, correctly classified more than 97% of the cases in the whole database (more than 11,500 cases), serving as a promising tool for the virtual screening of potent and safe anti-streptococci drugs.

AB By applying the lenses of institutional work, this study presents an empirical analysis on how agents create and manage a hybrid virtual organization to provide an innovative solution to the problem of the lack of occupational health (OH) services among small businesses. We specifically focus on how these actors exploit and balance the prescriptions of different logics within this hybrid organization. Our qualitative study showed that the funders manage this virtual social enterprise through two main strategies: 'commitment to the social mission' and 'support for the social mission'. The first strategy shows how the social mission helped a diverse group of funders and employees to work together as a team. The second strategy assists these actors to grant the maintenance and justify the existence of this novel organization, which provides immense societal benefits but could not support itself financially. This article shows how a hybrid organizations' capacity for innovation and societal advantages depends on the ability to rely on multiple logics and simultaneously to shift the attention on the social mission as a catalytic force for its survival.

AB The study explores how a complexity approach empowers science learning. A complexity approach represents systems as many interacting entities. The construct of micro-macro compatibility is introduced, the degree of similarity between behaviors at the micro- and macro-levels of the system. Seventh-grade students' learning about gases was studied using questionnaires and interviews. An experimental group (n = 47) learned with a complexity curriculum that included agent-based computer models, a workbook, class discussions, and laboratory experiments. A comparison group (n = 45) learned with a normative curriculum, incorporating lectures, a textbook, class discussions, and laboratory experiments. Significant learning gains and strong effect sizes were found in the experimental group's overall learning. Diffusion, density, and kinetic molecular theory were learned better with a complexity approach. Pressure, temperature, and the gas laws were learned similarly with both approaches. Learning to notice micro-level behaviors and their probabilistic nature was greater with the complexity approach. Analysis showed that only concepts that have less "micro-macro compatibility" were learned better with a complexity approach. Thus, a complexity approach helps separate the microbehaviors and then relate them to the macrobehaviors when these behaviors are dissimilar. We discuss how micro-macro compatibility helps point to concepts whose learning would benefit strongly from a complexity approach.

AB Mental model ascription-also called mindreading-is the process of inferring the mental states of others, which happens as a matter of course in social interactions. But although ubiquitous, mindreading is presumably a highly variable process: people mindread to different extents and with different results. We hypothesize that human mindreading ability relies on a large number of personal and contextual features: the inherent abilities of specific individuals, their current physical and mental states, their knowledge of the domain of discourse, their familiarity with the interlocutor, the risks associated with an incorrect assessment of intent, and so on. This paper presents a theory of mindreading that models diverse artificial intelligent agents using an inventory of parameters and value sets that represent traits of humans and features of discourse contexts. Examples are drawn from Maryland Virtual Patient, a prototype system that will permit medical trainees to diagnose and treat cognitively modeled virtual patients with the optional assistance of a virtual tutor. Since real patients vary greatly with respect to physiological and cognitive features, so must a society of virtual patients. Modeling such variation is one of the goals of the overall OntoAgent program of research and development.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the fracture resistance of simulated immature teeth after internal bleaching. The teeth were assigned as follows (n = 12/group); Group-1: The pulp chamber was filled with ProRootMTA and bleached intracoronally with sodium perborate mixed with 37% carbamide peroxide gel; Group-2: The pulp chamber was filled with ProRootMTA without bleaching; Group-3: The pulp chamber was filled with Biodentine and bleached intracoronally as Group-1; Group-4: The pulp chamber was filled with Biodentine without bleaching; and Group-5: Teeth received no intervention (control). The specimens were loaded vertically until root fracture occurred. The data were analysed with Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests. There was no significant difference between the fracture resistances of the experimental groups (P > 0.05). However, all experimental groups had significantly lower fracture resistance than the control group (P < 0.05). Neither the tested calcium silicate cements nor the bleaching procedures had a significant impact on fracture resistance values.

AB Humans have transformed much of Earth's land surface, giving rise to loss of biodiversity, climate change, and a host of other environmental issues that are affecting human and biophysical systems in unexpected ways. To confront these problems, environmental managers must consider human and landscape systems in integrated ways. This means making use of data obtained from a broad range of methods (e.g., sensors, surveys), while taking into account new findings from the social and biophysical science literatures. New integrative methods (including data fusion, simulation modeling, and participatory approaches) have emerged in recent years to address these challenges, and to allow analysts to provide information that links qualitative and quantitative elements for policymakers. This paper brings attention to these emergent tools while providing an overview of the tools currently in use for analysis of human-landscape interactions. Analysts are now faced with a staggering array of approaches in the human-landscape literature-in an attempt to bring increased clarity to the field, we identify the relative strengths of each tool, and provide guidance to analysts on the areas to which each tool is best applied. We discuss four broad categories of tools: statistical methods (including survival analysis, multi-level modeling, and Bayesian approaches), GIS and spatial analysis methods, simulation approaches (including cellular automata, agent-based modeling, and participatory modeling), and mixed-method techniques (such as alternative futures modeling and integrated assessment). For each tool, we offer an example from the literature of its application in human-landscape research. Among these tools, participatory approaches are gaining prominence for analysts to make the broadest possible array of information available to researchers, environmental managers, and policymakers. Further development of new approaches of data fusion and integration across sites or disciplines pose an important challenge for future work in integrating human and landscape components.

AB In order to survive, self-serving agents in various kinds of complex adaptive systems (CASs) must compete against others for sharing limited resources with biased or unbiased distribution by conducting strategic behaviors. This competition can globally result in the balance of resource allocation. As a result, most of the agents and species can survive well. However, it is a common belief that the formation of a herd in a CAS will cause excess volatility, which can ruin the balance of resource allocation in the CAS. Here this belief is challenged with the results obtained from a modeled resource-allocation system. Based on this system, we designed and conducted a series of computer-aided human experiments including herd behavior. We also performed agent-based simulations and theoretical analyses, in order to confirm the experimental observations and reveal the underlying mechanism. We report that, as long as the ratio of the two resources for allocation is biased enough, the formation of a typically sized herd can help the system to reach the balanced state. This resource ratio also serves as the critical point for a class of phase transition identified herein, which can be used to discover the role change of herd behavior, from a ruinous one to a helpful one. This work is also of value to some fields, ranging from management and social science, to ecology and evolution, and to physics.

AB In this work, we consider a system of coupled finite-difference equations which incorporates a variety of opinion formation models, and use it to describe the dynamics of opinions on controversial subjects. The social network consists of a finite number of agents with pairwise interactions at discrete times. Meanwhile, the opinion of each agent is updated following a general nonlinear law which considers parameters identified as the personal constants of each of the members. We establish conditions that guarantee the existence of global attracting points (strong consensus) and intervals (weak consensus). Moreover, we note that these conditions are independent of the weight matrix and the number of agents of the network. Two particular scenarios are investigated numerically in order to confirm the validity of the analytical results.

   INFORMATION; EMERGENCE
AB The understanding of cooperative behavior in social systems has been the subject of intense research over the past few decades. In this regard, the theoretical models used to explain cooperation in human societies have been complemented with a growing interest in experimental studies to validate the proposed mechanisms. In this work, we rely on previous experimental findings to build a theoretical model based on two cooperation driving mechanisms: second-order reputation and memory. Specifically, taking the donation game as a starting point, the agents are distributed among three strategies, namely, unconditional cooperators, unconditional defectors, and discriminators, where the latter follow a second-order assessment rule: shunning, stern judging, image scoring, or simple standing. A discriminator will cooperate if the evaluation of the recipient's last actions contained in his memory is above a threshold of (in)tolerance. In addition to the dynamics inherent to the game, another imitation dynamics, involving much longer times (generations), is introduced. The model is approached through a mean-field approximation that predicts the macroscopic behavior observed in Monte Carlo simulations. We found that, while in most second-order assessment rules, intolerance hinders cooperation, it has the opposite (positive) effect under the simple standing rule. Furthermore, we show that, when considering memory, the stern judging rule shows the lowest values of cooperation, while stricter rules show higher cooperation levels.

AB Emotions are an important aspect of human intelligence and have been shown to play a significant role in the human decision-making process. Researchers in areas such as cognitive science, philosophy, and artificial intelligence have proposed a variety of models of emotions. Most of the previous models focus on an agent's reactive behavior, for which they often generate emotions according to static rules or pre-determined domain knowledge. However, throughout the history of research on emotions, memory and experience have been emphasized to have a major influence on the emotional process. In this paper, we propose a new computational model of emotions that can be incorporated into intelligent agents and other complex, interactive programs. The model uses a fuzzy-logic representation to map events and observations to emotional states. The model also includes several inductive learning algorithms for learning patterns of events, associations among objects, and expectations. We demonstrate empirically through a computer simulation of a pet that the adaptive components of the model are crucial to users' assessments of the believability of the agent's interactions.

ID MODEL
AB Mobility services increasingly consider the sharing of vehicles to reduce resource use and congestion. People are, however, reluctant to sharing vehicles with strangers. Therefore, this paper investigates the dynamic co-evolution of taxi-sharing behaviours and the taxi-sharing-oriented social network structure. A social network based taxi-sharing method is introduced that is able to prioritise taxi-sharing with acquaintances over strangers while capping the detour cost to reasonable and varied limits. Furthermore, the social network structure evolves and is updated based on shared trips. An empirical simulation demonstrates the advantages of social network based taxi-sharing, i.e., an increased match rate and a comparable satisfaction level to trip-based methods. The spatial aggregation of the emerging social network not only suggests a space-time searching heuristic for taxi-sharing, but also indicates how social factors conquer space while space constrains social interactions.

ID PRICE CHANGES; MODEL; BEHAVIOR; RETURNS; FACTS; LIMIT
AB Effects of herding on the order book dynamics of a double auction market is studied by an agent-based model. This is done by comparing results from a zero-intelligence model and a model in which herding effect is implemented by aggregation of agents who take market orders into opinion groups. The number of opinion groups in a simulation step is determined from previous volatilities of the market as different agents compare the price change over different time intervals. Besides confirming that when herding is included the tail of the distribution of volatility is enhanced, we found several new results. First, the autocorrelation time of volatility is much shorter than the memory of most of the agents because limit orders have strong influence on the location of best bid and best ask. Second, from the relation between bid-ask imbalance and price return we find that herding reduces the chance for a small imbalance to produce a large price change. Furthermore, herding tends to decrease spread. This is because herding decreases the chance that a market order changes the size of the spread. Finally, we find that the relation between spread and volatility in our models does not agree with empirical data, this indicates a difference between agents with no strategies and agents in real financial markets.

AB The behavior of human erythrocytes and 1-mum-diameter fluorescent latex beads in the presence of Optison(R) contrast agent in a single half-wavelength (lambda/2) ultrasound standing wave (USSW) resonator has been studied. The particle movements were observed with an epi-fluorescent microscope and the velocity of the particles and-cells was measured by particle image velocimetry (PIV). Acoustic emissions were. monitored with a microphone and a spectrum analyzer. Optison(R) contrast agent disintegrated immediately on exposure to ultrasound of 0.98-MPa acoustic pressure amplitude or higher in a chamber driven at its resonance frequency of 1.56 MHz. A discrete cloud of active microbubbles, detected at the pressure node plane, disappeared gradually and was completely lost within 15 s. The microscopy showed three-dimensional regions of circulation of both 1-mum tracer particles and erythrocytes in planes perpendicular to the pressure node plane. A numerical simulation showed that, for parameters that conform to the experimental conditions, a bubble of a subresonance size moves towards and translates about a pressure node plane. This result is in agreement with the experimental observation that the particle and cell circulation is induced by the presence and/or translational motion of microbubbles at the pressure node plane.

AB Changes in the intensity and type of facial expressions reflect alterations in the emotional state of the agent. Such "direct" access to the other's affective state might, top-down, influence the perception of the facial expressions that gave rise to the affective state inference. Previously, we described a perceptual bias occurring when the last, neutral, expression of offsets of facial expressions (joy-to-neutral and anger-to-neutral), was evaluated. Individuals with high-functioning autism (HFA) and matched typically developed (TD) individuals rated the neutral expression at the end of the joy-offset videos as slightly angry and the identical neutral expression at the end of the anger-offset videos as slightly happy ("overshoot" bias). That study suggested that the perceptual overshoot response bias in the TD group could be best explained by top-down "emotional anticipation," i.e., the involuntary/ automatic anticipation of the agent's next emotional state of mind, generated by the immediately preceding perceptual history (low-level mind reading). The experimental manipulations further indicated that in the HFA group the " overshoot" was better explained by contrast effects between the first and last facial expressions, both presented for a relatively long period of 400 ms. However, in principle, there is another, more parsimonious, explanation, which is pattern extrapolation or representational momentum (RM): the extrapolation of a pattern present in the dynamic sequence. This hypothesis is tested in the current study, in which 18 individuals with HFA and a matched control group took part. In a base-line condition, joy-offset and anger-offset video-clips were presented. In the new experimental condition, the clips were modified so as to create an offset-onset-offset pattern within each sequence (joy-to-anger-to-neutral and anger-to-joy-to-neutral). The final neutral expressions had to be evaluated. The overshoot bias was confirmed in the base-line condition for both TD and HFA groups, while the experimental manipulation removed the bias in both groups. This outcome ruled out pattern extrapolation or RM as explanation for the perceptual " overshoot" bias in the HFA group and suggested a role for facial contrast effects in HFA. This is compatible with the view that ASD individuals tend to lack the spontaneous " tracking" of changes in the others' affective state and hence show no or reduced emotional anticipation.

AB We propose and analyze a stochastic model for opinion dynamics over social networks. In the scenario considered, each agent has an opinion level which belongs to a discrete set. At any given time, the agent takes an action 0 or 1 depending on the opinion, and this action can be seen as a binary signal that can influence the other agents in the network. The opinion updates based on the signal from a random neighbor or from an external entity who attempts to manipulate or control the network. In the absence of the external signal or a constant signal, this model is shown to asymptotically produce consensus with a finite number of connected agents. Additionally, the consensus is determined by the signal. On the other hand, when the number of agents is large, the time to achieve consensus can become exponentially large and the dynamics exhibit population equilibrium points that are "metastable". These equilibria can be observed with a finite (but large) number of agents through numerical simulations and are shown to persist for a long duration. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Wave and vortex fine structure of unsteady stratified flows were studied numerically based on the system of fundamental equations for non-homogeneous incompressible fluid with no-slip and no-flux boundary conditions, and experimentally using high-resolution Schlieren visualization techniques. Different flow regimes, including creeping, wave and vortex ones, which are widespread in the ocean and atmosphere, were investigated in the single problem formulation, starting from the slowest diffusion-induced flows up to the fastest and unsteady ones. A classification of flow components is proposed, which contains waves, vortices, and ligaments, which manifest themselves in the form of extended interfaces with their transverse scales being determined by the dissipative properties of a fluid and the flow dynamics. Due to interrupting the molecular flux of a stratifying agent on a motionless obstacle, fine structural diffusion-induced flows are formed around the obstacle in the form of a multilevel set of vortex cells which are transformed near the edges into horizontally extended streaky structures. A moving body in a stratified fluid produces upstream disturbances, groups of attached internal waves, leading-edge vortices, and a vortex street in the wake, which coexist in the stratified flow as an organic whole and are separated with ligaments. In the unsteady vortex flow regime, the shape of the bluff body essentially affects the flow structure, determining whether it will consist of a quasi-steady chain of vortices with a quite regular vortex shedding structure, or leading-edge vortices and vortex street would evolve into a much more complex and multi-scale vortex evolution. The numerical and experimental visualizations of diffusion-induced flows, internal waves, vortex streets, and fine structural ligaments, are in a qualitative agreement with each other.

AB Unpopular norms are a pervasive and puzzling phenomenon of the social world. They are norms that are established and maintained against the interest of their subjects, but without external coercion. Pluralistic ignorance has been suggested as a potential explanation of unpopular norms. What is currently lacking is a formal model of this process that can be meaningfully compared with empirically known properties of pluralistic ignorance. An agent-based model of a growing social network can reproduce the most significant qualitative features, viz a deviation of the perceived norm from the preference distribution and the dynamical lag of the former behind the latter. In addition, the model is extended with a central influence representing for example central media or a powerful political elite.

AB Objective To examine the validity and usefulness of pandemic simulations aimed at informing practical decision-making in public health.
   Methods We recruited a multidisciplinary group of nine experts to assess a case-study simulation of influenza transmission in a Swedish county. We used a non-statistical nominal group technique to generate evaluations of the plausibility, formal validity (verification) and predictive validity of the simulation. A health-effect assessment structure was used as a framework for data collection.
   Findings The unpredictability, of social order during disasters was not adequately addressed by simulation methods; even minor disruptions of the social order may invalidate key infrastructural assumptions underpinning current pandemic simulation models. Further, a direct relationship between model flexibility and computation time was noted. Consequently, simulation methods cannot, in practice, support integrated modifications of microbiological, epidemiological and spatial submodels or handle multiple parallel scenarios.
   Conclusion The combination of incomplete surveillance data and simulation methods that neglect social dynamics limits the ability of national public health agencies to provide policy-makers and the general public with the critical and timely information needed during a pandemic.

AB This paper illustrates what psychologists can do and learn from the use of intelligent agent-based simulations, in combination with experimental designs, in order to model the behavioral interaction of motorists and motorcyclists in urban traffic, when motorcyclists ride in between the lanes of slow-moving or stopped vehicles. The results of the computer model were validated through a measure that estimates its agreement with the results of real-life traffic videos analyses. Lastly, this paper discusses the implications of adopting intelligent agent-based simulations in experimental psychology. (C) 2016 Fundacion Universitaria Konrad Lorenz.

AB We present an analysis of the properties of a social network, formed by users participating in one of the most popular Polish political discussion forums, during a period of two years. We find that despite communication motivated mostly by controversy and negative emotions, the resulting social network is remarkably similar to networks found in discussion boards based on similarity of views. All collected messages have been analyzed to determine their content type, author's political sympathies and emotion level. This has allowed us to discover almost complete stability of the political sympathies of the users writing comments during the studied period. Using the data on reader evaluation of the comments we present estimates of the political sympathies of the "silent majority" of forum readers and found that they follow closely the distribution of sympathies of comment authors. The data from the observations are used as the input for an agent based computer simulation model, reproducing many observed statistical characteristics of the forum.

AB Understanding how people form and revise their perception of risk is central to designing efficient risk communication methods, eliciting risk awareness, and avoiding unnecessary anxiety among the public. However, public responses to hazardous events such as climate change, contagious outbreaks, and terrorist threats are complex and difficult-to-anticipate phenomena. Although many psychological factors influencing risk perception have been identified in the past, it remains unclear how perceptions of risk change when propagated from one person to another and what impact the repeated social transmission of perceived risk has at the population scale. Here, we study the social dynamics of risk perception by analyzing how messages detailing the benefits and harms of a controversial antibacterial agent undergo change when passed from one person to the next in 10-subject experimental diffusion chains. Our analyses show that when messages are propagated through the diffusion chains, they tend to become shorter, gradually inaccurate, and increasingly dissimilar between chains. In contrast., the perception of risk is propagated with higher fidelity due to participants manipulating messages to fit their preconceptions, thereby influencing the judgments of subsequent participants. Computer simulations implementing this simple influence mechanism show that small judgment biases tend to become more extreme, even when the injected message contradicts preconceived risk judgments. Our results provide quantitative insights into the social amplification of risk perception, and can help policy makers better anticipate and manage the public response to emerging threats.

AB The rapid changes occurring in the higher education domain are placing increasing pressure on the actors in this space to focus efforts on identifying and adopting strategies for success. One particular group of interest are academics or scientists, and the ways that these individuals, or collectives as institutional or discipline-based science systems, make decisions about how best to achieve success in their chosen field. The agent-based model and simulation that we present draws on the hypothetical "strategic publication model" proposed by Molders, Fink and Weyer (2011), and extends this work by defining experimental settings to implement a prototype ABMS in NetLogo. While considerable work remains to fully resolve theoretical issues relating to the scope, calibration and validation of the model, this work goes some way toward resolving some of the details associated with defining appropriate experimental settings. Also presented are the results of four experiments that focus on exploring the emergent effects of the system that result from varying the strategic mix of actors in the system.

AB Dendrimeric peptides make a versatile group of bioactive peptidomimetics and a potential new class of antimicrobial agents to tackle the pressing threat of multi-drug resistant pathogens. These are branched supramolecular assemblies where multiple copies of the bioactive unit are linked to a central core. Beyond their antimicrobial activity, dendrimeric peptides could also be designed to functionalize the surface of nanoparticles or materials for other medical uses. Despite these properties, however, little is known about the structure-function relationship of such compounds, which is key to unveil the fundamental physico-chemical parameters and design analogues with desired attributes. To close this gap, we focused on a semi-synthetic, two-branched peptide, SB056, endowed with remarkable activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and limited cytotoxicity. SB056 can be considered the smallest prototypical dendrimeric peptide, with the core restricted to a single lysine residue and only two copies of the same highly cationic 10-mer polypeptide; an octanamide tail is present at the C-terminus. Combining NMR and Molecular Dynamics simulations, we have determined the 3D structure of two analogues. Fluorescence spectroscopy was applied to investigate the water-bilayer partition in the presence of vesicles of variable charge. Vesicle leakage assays were also performed and the experimental data were analyzed by applying an iterative Monte Carlo scheme to estimate the minimum number of bound peptides needed to achieve the release. We unveiled a singular beta hairpin-type structure determined by the peptide chains only, with the octanamide tail available for further functionalization to add new potential properties without affecting the structure.

AB Social reward, as a significant mechanism explaining the evolution of cooperation, has attracted great attention both theoretically and experimentally. In this paper, we study the evolution of cooperation by proposing a reward model in network population, where a third strategy, reward, as an independent yet particular type of cooperation is introduced in 2-person evolutionary games. Specifically, a new kind of role corresponding to reward strategy, reward agents, is defined, which is aimed at increasing the income of cooperators by applying to them a social reward. Results from numerical simulations show that consideration of social reward greatly promotes the evolution of cooperation, which is confirmed for different network topologies and two evolutionary games. Moreover, we explore the microscopic mechanisms for the promotion of cooperation in the three-strategy model. As expected, the reward agents play a vital role in the formation of cooperative clusters, thus resisting the aggression of defectors. Our research might provide valuable insights into further exploring the nature of cooperation in the real world.

AB During the past decade, social mechanisms and mechanism-based explanations have received considerable attention in the social sciences as well as in the philosophy of science. This article critically reviews the most important philosophical and social science contributions to the mechanism approach. The first part discusses the idea of mechanism-based explanation from the point of view of philosophy of science and relates it to causation and to the covering-law account of explanation. The second part focuses on how the idea of mechanisms has been used in the social sciences. The final part discusses recent developments in analytical sociology, covering the nature of sociological explananda, the role of theory of action in mechanism based explanations, Merton's idea of middle-range theory, and the role of agent-based simulations in the development of mechanism-based explanations.

AB Bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDc) is a multi-factorial disease, involving both viral and bacterial pathogens, that negatively impacts the cattle feedlot industry. A nitric oxide releasing solution (NORS) has been developed and shown to have potential in the prevention of BRDc. This study investigated the underlying immunological mechanisms through which the nitroslyating agent NORS provides protection against the development of BRDc in susceptible cattle. An in vitro BRDc experimental model was designed using bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) which were infected with bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1) and subsequently cultured with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) extracted from Mannheimia haemolytica bacteria. The cells were treated with NORS following viral infection to reflect the timing of administering the NORS treatment in feedlots during initial processing. An expression and protein analysis of key genes involved in the innate immune response was carried out. The BRDc model produced significant increases in gene expression (p < 0.01) and protein release (p < 0.05) of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta and TNF. Treatment with NORS reduced the protein levels of IL-1 beta (0.39-fold down arrow) (p < 0.05) and TNF (0.48-fold down arrow) (p < 0.01) in the BRDc experimental group when compared against the non-treatment BRDc controls. TLR4 expression, having been significantly reduced under the BRDc experimental conditions (0.33-fold down arrow) (p < 0.05), increased significantly (0.76-fold up arrow) (p < 0.05) following NORS treatment. This study provides evidence suggesting that NO may protect against the development of BRDc by limiting deleterious inflammation while simultaneously increasing TLR4 expression and enhancing the ability of the host to detect and respond to bacterial pathogens.

AB The aim of this article is to analyze the impact of development interventions on the population of three Nigerien villages that differ in terms of their agro-ecological, social and economic characteristics. This is performed by simulating the behavior of individuals in an agent-based modeling framework which integrates the village characteristics as well as the family internal rules that condition access to economic and production activities. Villagers are differentiated according to the social and agro-ecological constraints they are subjected to. Two development project interventions are simulated, assuming no land scarcity: increasing the availability of inorganic fertilizers for farmers and an inventory credit technique based on millet grain. Two distinct approaches were used to model the rationale of farmers' decision making: gains or losses in economic value or gains or losses in within-village "reputation". Our results show that village populations do not respond en masse to development interventions. Reputation has little effect on the population behavior and should be considered more as a local proxy for wealth amongst villagers, suggesting the monetization of these societies. Populations involve themselves in the two simulated development interventions only at sites where savings are possible. Some level of household food security and investment capacity is actually required to take part in the development interventions, which are largely conditioned by family manpower and size. As long as uncultivated land remains available in the village territory, support for inorganic fertilizers has little impact in the absence of any intensification process. Inventory credit engages a maximum of 25% of the population at the site with medium agro-ecological conditions. Therefore, both interventions should be viewed as a potential support tool for a limited part of the population capable of going beyond the survival level, but not as a generic poverty-alleviation panacea.

AB This paper presents a new distributed control scheme to achieve both accurate voltage restoration and precise current sharing for islanded dc microgrid (MG) system only with limited noncontinuous communication among the distributed generators (DGs). A two-layer multiagent framework is employed for this MG system, which consists of a physical layer and a cyber layer. A distributed voltage restoration control scheme is proposed in the cyber layer, where no overall system information is required and only dc bus voltage feedback is needed. Furthermore, by employing the idea of event-triggered communication, our proposed approach only relies on limited aperiodic communication, which greatly reduces the communication cost in the cyber layer. The stability of proposed method is analyzed through a Lyapunov function based approach and we also demonstrate that the Zeno behavior can be excluded if a proper event-triggered condition is established. Our proposed method is validated in an islanded dc MG test system built in the Simulink environment and an experimental prototype consisting of three DGs simultaneously.

ID MODEL
AB To make good decisions in a social context, humans often need to recognize the plan underlying the behavior of others, and make predictions based on this recognition. This process, when carried out by software agents or robots, is known as plan recognition, or agent modeling. Most existing techniques for plan recognition assume the availability of carefully hand-crafted plan libraries, which encode the a-priori known behavioral repertoire of the observed agents; during run-time, plan recognition algorithms match the observed behavior of the agents against the plan-libraries, and matches are reported as hypotheses. Unfortunately, techniques for automatically acquiring plan-libraries from observations, e. g., by learning or data-mining, are only beginning to emerge.
   We present an approach for automatically creating the model of an agent behavior based on the observation and analysis of its atomic behaviors. In this approach, observations of an agent behavior are transformed into a sequence of atomic behaviors (events). This stream is analyzed in order to get the corresponding behavior model, represented by a distribution of relevant events. Once the model has been created, the proposed approach presents a method using a statistical test for classifying an observed behavior. Therefore, in this research, the problem of behavior classification is examined as a problem of learning to characterize the behavior of an agent in terms of sequences of atomic behaviors. The experiment results of this paper show that a system based on our approach can efficiently recognize different behaviors in different domains, in particular UNIX command-line data, and RoboCup soccer simulation.

AB The unseeded batch-emulsion polymerisation of methyl methacrylate (MMA) was investigated using the chain transfer agent iso-octyl-3-mercaptopropionate (iOMP), which exhibits a low environmental impact. The commercial iOMP is a mixture of over 10 isomers that proved adequate to control the molecular weights of poly(methyl methacrylate) with a decreasing evolution of both the number- and weight-average molecular weights along the reactions. The iOMP also affects the polymerisation kinetics as a consequence of the lower reactivity of the iOMP radicals with respect to the MMA-ended radicals. Experimental results were interpreted with the help of a first principles mathematical model. (c) 2013 Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering

AB This paper studies information design in social networks. We consider a setting, where agents' actions exhibit positive local network externalities. There is uncertainty about the underlying state of the world, which impacts agents' payoffs. The platform can commit to a signaling mechanism that sends informative signals to agents upon realization of this uncertainty, thereby influencing their actions. Although this abstract setting has many applications, we discuss our results in the context of a specific one: A platform can send informative signals to agents in a social network to influence their engagement decisions with the available content, based on the realization of the inaccuracy of the content. We investigate how the platform should design its signaling mechanism to maximize engagement/minimize misinformation. The optimal (in terms of engagement/misinformation) signaling mechanism admits a simple threshold structure: The platform recommends that agents "engage" with the content if its inaccuracy level is below a threshold and recommends "do not engage" otherwise. For the mechanism that maximizes engagement, these thresholds depend on agents' network positions, which we capture through a novel centrality measure. In the case where the platform seeks only to minimize misinformation (regardless of the induced engagement), common threshold mechanisms with identical thresholds across agents are optimal. This is in contrast to the engagement maximization setting, where when agents are heterogeneous in terms of their network positions, common threshold mechanisms induce substantially lower engagement than the optimal mechanisms. We also study the frontier of the engagement/misinformation levels that can be achieved via different mechanisms and characterize when common threshold mechanisms achieve optimal trade-offs. Finally, we supplement our theoretical findings with numerical simulations on a Facebook subgraph.

AB This paper examines the descriptive power and the limitations of a simple reinforcement learning model (REL), comparing the simulation results with the results of an economic experiment employing human subjects. Agent-based computational economics and experimental economics are becoming increasingly popular as tools for economists. A new variety of learning model using games with a unique equilibrium is proposed and examined in both of the fields mentioned above. However, little attention is given to games with multiple equilibria. We examine threshold public goods games with two types of equilibria, where each player in a five-person group simultaneously contributes the public goods from her private endowments. In the experiments, we observe two patterns of the subjects' behavior: the cooperative and non-cooperative patterns. Our simulation results show that the REL reproduces the cooperative pattern, but does not reproduce the non-cooperative pattern. However, the results suggest that the REL does reproduce the non-cooperative pattern in terms of the agents' internal states. That implies that deterministic strategies would be required to reproduce the non-cooperative pattern in the games. We show an example of the REL with deterministic strategies.

AB Using molecular dynamics simulations, we modeled solvation and diffusion in aqueous solutions cif organophosphorous compounds, including nerve G-agents sarin and soman (methylphosphonofluoridates) and their common simulants DMMP (dimethyl methylphosphonate) and DIFP (diisopropyl fluorophosphate). The aqueous solutions of the organophosphorous compounds were found to display complex molecular scale structures and dynamic properties due to competing interactions between strongly hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups. The mixing of agents with water was proved to be exothermic with negative excess mixing volume, indicating a strongly hydrophilic solvation. This effect was confirmed in a specially performed experiment. We discuss to what extent DMMP and DIFP are suitable simulants for G-agents in experimental studies, as far as their interactions with water are concerned. We also focus on the relevance of the structural features and mobilities of agents in water to their interactions with permselective polyelectrolyte membranes that may be employed as protective barriers against chemical warfare agents.

AB This paper studies opinion dynamics for a set of heterogeneous populations of individuals pursuing two conflicting goals: to seek consensus and to be coherent with their initial opinions. The multi-population game under investigation is characterized by (i) rational agents who behave strategically, (ii) heterogeneous populations, and (iii) opinions evolving in response to local interactions. The main contribution of this paper is to encompass all of these aspects under the unified framework of mean-field game theory. We show that, assuming initial Gaussian density functions and affine control policies, the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation preserves Gaussianity over time. This fact is then used to explicitly derive expressions for the optimal control strategies when the players are myopic. We then explore consensus formation depending on the stubbornness of the involved populations: We identify conditions that lead to some elementary patterns, such as consensus, polarization, or plurality of opinions. Finally, under the baseline example of the presence of a stubborn population and a most gregarious one, we study the behavior of the model with a finite number of players, describing the dynamics of the average opinion, which is now a stochastic process. We also provide numerical simulations to show how the parameters impact the equilibrium formation.

AB A new hyperdispersant agent with maleic anhydride monoester as anchoring group, butylmethacrylate as solventable chain, and styrene (St) as functional group was synthesized, and named SMB. Also, the effects of nanometer-TiO2 (nano-TiO2) modification and concentration on the mechanical properties of polypropylene/polyamide/maleic anhydride-grafted polypropylene (70/30/5 by weight) composites were investigated. The experimental results indicated that the mechanical properties of polypropylene/polyamide 6/M blend reduced with the addition of p-TiO2 (unmodified nano-TiO2) due to the aggregation of nanoparticles, but improved by the addition of t-TiO2 (modified by titanate coupling agent TDI) or SMB-TiO2 (modified by hyperdispersant agent SMB), and SMB-TiO2 seemed to be more effective. The optimum content of SMB-TiO2 was found to be 3wt%. In order to understand the reinforcing mechanisms of nanoparticles, SEM and TEM pictures were carried out, which revealed that SMB-TiO2 mainly distributed at the interface of polypropylene and polyamide 6 in nanoscale as compatibilizer. It could be due to the surface of nano-TiO2 coated with SMB, and the carboxy group of SMB could react with the functional group of PA6; meanwhile, the solventable chain had good compatibility with PP, and so the interaction between PP and PA6 increased in the presence of SMB-TiO2. Consequently, PP/PA6/M blend could be simultaneously strengthened and toughened by SMB-TiO2.

AB Children ages 3-9 years were informed that an invisible agent (Princess Alice) would help them play a forced-choice game by "telling them, somehow, when they chose the wrong box," whereas a matched control group of children were not given this supernatural prime. On 2 unexpected event trials, an experimenter triggered a simulated unexpected event (i.e., a light turning on/off; a picture falling), and children's behavioral response to these events (i.e., moving their hand to the opposite box) was coded. Results showed a significant Age Group X Experimental Condition interaction; the only children to reliably alter their behavior in response to the unexpected events were the oldest children (M = 7 years 4 months), who were primed with the invisible agent concept. For children's posttest verbal explanations, also, only these children saw the unexpected events as being referential and declarative (e.g., "Princess Alice did it because I chose the wrong box"). Together, these data suggest that children may not regularly begin to see communicative signs as embedded in unexpected events until they are around 7 years of age.

AB Why do social democrats retrench the welfare state? Next to violating core social democratic principles, recent studies show that social democratic parties - and not so much other parties - are systematically punished after retrenchment by (severe) vote losses. We propose and show that the strategy a party employs - policy-seeking, office-seeking or vote-seeking - is crucial for explaining why and when social democrats retrench, because it influences how they respond to environmental incentives (economy, public opinion, activist opinion and opposition strategy). The intra-party balance of power determines which strategy a party employs. We simulate an agent-based model to examine the implications of the different party strategies for the behavior of social democrats regarding welfare state retrenchment. This model includes 1) agents (here: parties) with specific decision heuristics that operationalize the different strategies, 2) voters who use a proximity-rule and 3) a coalition formation model. To mimic reality as much as possible, we calibrate the model with real economic data, whereby these data affect voters' policy preferences. We find that social democrats with a vote-seeking strategy retrench when inflation pushes the mean voter to the right. Office-seeking social democrats behave similarly, but respond with a strong time lag to the economy and to public opinion. Policy-seeking social democrats do not retrench. Moreover, we find that when faced with a radical left-wing competitor, social democrats shift towards the centre - irrespective of their strategy -, increasing the likelihood that social democrats retrench. An empirical illustration of the behavior of five social democratic parties corroborates the simulations' results. To the welfare state literature, we offer a dynamic model that predicts under which conditions social democrats engage in welfare state retrenchment. To the literature on simulations, we offer an application of a model that makes predictions for a specific policy field, using real economic data and party decision rules.

AB This article analytically characterizes optimal social insurance in an economy with both ex ante heterogeneity and ex post risk, decomposing the benefits of social insurance into a redistributive and insurance benefit. Agents exert effort to increase the likelihood of high outcome events and are additionally supplied actuarially fair private insurance for this earnings risk. This article is novel in its joint consideration of two sources of heterogeneity, two potential sources of insurance, and an endogenous ex post distribution of outcomes. The introduction of optimal private insurance eliminates the insurance benefit of social insurance, but leaves the redistributive benefit intact. An income effect induced by the crowding out of private insurance generates an additional benefit to social insurance when it takes the form of a linear income tax. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate how the relative contributions of ex ante and ex post risk differentially impact the welfare loss associated with setting optimal social insurance without recognizing the presence of private insurance.

AB In this paper, the flight formation control problem of a group of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with parametric uncertainties and external disturbances is studied. Unit-quaternions are used to represent the attitudes of the quadrotor UAVs. Separating the model into a translational subsystem and a rotational subsystem, an intermediary control input is introduced to track a desired velocity and extract desired orientations. Then considering the internal parametric uncertainties and external disturbances of the quadrotor UAVs, the priori-bounded intermediary adaptive control input is designed for velocity tracking and formation keeping, by which the bounded control thrust and the desired orientation can be extracted. Thereafter, an adaptive control torque input is designed for the rotational subsystem to track the desired orientation. With the proposed control scheme, the desired velocity is tracked and a desired formation shape is built up. Global stability of the closed-loop system is proven via Lyapunov-based stability analysis. Numerical simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

AB Experimental postexcitation signal data of collapsing Definity microbubbles are compared with the Marmottant theoretical model for large amplitude oscillations of ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs). After taking into account the insonifying pulse characteristics and size distribution of the population of UCAs, a good comparison between simulated results and previously measured experimental data is obtained by determining a threshold maximum radial expansion (R-max) to indicate the onset of postexcitation. This threshold R-max is found to range from 3.4 to 8.0 times the initial bubble radius, R-0, depending on insonification frequency. These values are well above the typical free bubble inertial cavitation threshold commonly chosen at 2R(0). The close agreement between the experiment and models suggests that lipid-shelled UCAs behave as unshelled bubbles during most of a large amplitude cavitation cycle, as proposed in the Marmottant equation.

TI Social Experiments in the Mesoscale: Humans Playing a Spatial Prisoner's
   Dilemma
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID EVOLUTIONARY GAMES; COOPERATION; RULES
AB Background: The evolutionary origin of cooperation among unrelated individuals remains a key unsolved issue across several disciplines. Prominent among the several mechanisms proposed to explain how cooperation can emerge is the existence of a population structure that determines the interactions among individuals. Many models have explored analytically and by simulation the effects of such a structure, particularly in the framework of the Prisoner's Dilemma, but the results of these models largely depend on details such as the type of spatial structure or the evolutionary dynamics. Therefore, experimental work suitably designed to address this question is needed to probe these issues.
   Methods and Findings: We have designed an experiment to test the emergence of cooperation when humans play Prisoner's Dilemma on a network whose size is comparable to that of simulations. We find that the cooperation level declines to an asymptotic state with low but nonzero cooperation. Regarding players' behavior, we observe that the population is heterogeneous, consisting of a high percentage of defectors, a smaller one of cooperators, and a large group that shares features of the conditional cooperators of public goods games. We propose an agent-based model based on the coexistence of these different strategies that is in good agreement with all the experimental observations.
   Conclusions: In our large experimental setup, cooperation was not promoted by the existence of a lattice beyond a residual level (around 20%) typical of public goods experiments. Our findings also indicate that both heterogeneity and a "moody" conditional cooperation strategy, in which the probability of cooperating also depends on the player's previous action, are required to understand the outcome of the experiment. These results could impact the way game theory on graphs is used to model human interactions in structured groups.

DE Big Data; computational social science; analytics; data science
AB This article reviews computational social science methods and their relation to conventional methodology and statistics. Computational social science has three important features. Firstly, it often involves big data; data sets so large that conventional database and analysis techniques cannot handle them with ease. Secondly, dealing with these big data sets has given rise to analysis techniques that are specially developed for big data. Given the size of the data, resampling and cross-validation approaches become feasible that allow both data-driven exploration and checks on overfitting the data. A third important feature is simulation, especially agent-based simulation. Here size also matters. Agent-based simulation is well known in social science, but modern computer equipment and software allows simulations of unprecedented scale. Many of these techniques, especially the resampling and cross-validation approaches, are potentially very useful for social scientists. Given the relatively small size of social science "big data" is useful to explore how well these techniques perform with smaller data sets. Social science methodology can contribute to this field by exploring if well-known methodological distinctions between external validity, internal validity, and construct validity can help clear up discussions on data quality (veracity) in computational social science.

AB Aggregation is a prerequisite for transitions from a solitary to a social life. One evolutionary route to sociality implies the maintenance of cohesion among juveniles. The study of the influence of ontogenesis on mutual tolerance appears of fundamental importance for understanding social transitions. Spiders are particularly relevant models to address these questions. All solitary spiders have a transient gregarious phase prior to their dispersal and solitary and social species are included within the same genus. We characterized the patterns of aggregation during ontogenesis in the solitary spider Agelena labyrinthica. Our results showed that the intensity of aggregation in solitary spiderlings declined from the day of emergence to the sixth week. We developed an agent-based model implementing behavioural rules measured experimentally to explore their relative contribution in the ontogenetic shift in social behaviours observed in solitary spiders. Combining experimental and theoretical approaches, we demonstrated that aggregation relied on a modulation of individual behaviours depending on the number of conspecifics perceived locally and that the decline in aggregation with age relied on variations in the strength of interattraction occurring during ontogenesis.

AB Existing opinion dynamics models often fail to consider the relationship between one agent and people two degrees of separation from the agent. In addition, no accurate weight determination method has yet been fully developed. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a two-step communication opinion dynamics model based on the classical DeGroot model. Self-persistence is introduced to measure the individual's adherence to the initial opinion, and a new weight determination method proposed that instead of distributing the weights evenly, defines an influence index that is calculated from the self-persistence and node degrees. To guide public opinion using the proposed opinion dynamics model, an optimization model is established by assuming a connected network; however, when the given network is not connected, a subnetwork recognition algorithm is developed and an edge adding algorithm is proposed to alter the structure. Three opinion control strategies are then used to control the opinion formation process. Numerical examples are given to verify the flexibility and practicality of the proposed opinion control strategies, and extensive simulations over random ER networks are given to provide insights into the parameter behavior of the three strategies.

AB Objectives: The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effects of casein phosphopeptides (CPP)-ACPF, NovaMin+ fluoride-containing toothpaste and Xylitol+ fluoride containing cream on demineralized areas on the enamel surface. Materials and Methods: A total of 100 enamel slab samples was prepared to investigate in the laboratory experiments. For this purpose, a total of 50 freshly extracted third molar teeth which completed root formation split into two portions in the mesiodistal direction. Enamel surfaces were immersed in a pH cycling protocol as described in the literature to simulate oral conditions for 9 days in order to evaluate the effect of test materials on the artificial enamel lesions. Then the remineralization agents were applied on the enamel surfaces, and we analyzed their effects. Results: We used Vickers Microhardness with the purpose of calculating the amount of lost or acquisition of minerals on the enamel surface qualitatively; inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) to define the calcium and phosphorus ions that dissolved in acid. One-way ANOVA and Tukey's T Post-Hoc tests were performed to distinguish significant differences among groups (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Remineralization was provided in all treated groups, according to the data obtained from all tests. NovaMin was more effective in increasing acid resistance. It was also found that all three experimental groups were effective in increasing the surface hardness, but CPP-ACPF and NovaMin are more effective than Xylitol. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the experimental groups.

AB Progress in understanding and managing complex systems comprised of decision-making agents, such as cells, organisms, ecosystems or societies, is-like many scientific endeavours-limited by disciplinary boundaries. These boundaries, however, are moving and can actively be made porous or even disappear. To study this process, I advanced an original bibliometric approach based on network analysis to track and understand the development of the model-based science of agent-based complex systems (ACS). I analysed research citations between the two communities devoted to ACS research, namely agent-based (ABM) and individual-based modelling (IBM). Both terms refer to the same approach, yet the former is preferred in engineering and social sciences, while the latter prevails in natural sciences. This situation provided a unique case study for grasping how a new concept evolves distinctly across scientific domains and how to foster convergence into a universal scientific approach. The present analysis based on novel heterocitation metrics revealed the historical development of ABM and IBM, confirmed their past disjointedness, and detected their progressive merger. The separation between these synonymous disciplines had silently opposed the free flow of knowledge among ACS practitioners and thereby hindered the transfer of methodological advances and the emergence of general systems theories. A surprisingly small number of key publications sparked the ongoing fusion between ABM and IBM research. Beside reviews raising awareness of broad-spectrum issues, generic protocols for model formulation and boundary-transcending inference strategies were critical means of science integration. Accessible broad-spectrum software similarly contributed to this change. From the modelling viewpoint, the discovery of the unification of ABM and IBM demonstrates that a wide variety of systems substantiate the premise of ACS research that microscale behaviours of agents and system-level dynamics are inseparably bound.

AB How people understand the actions of animate agents has been vigorously debated. This debate has centered on two hypotheses focused on anatomically distinct neural substrates: The mirror-system hypothesis proposes that the understanding of others is achieved via action simulation, and the social-network hypothesis proposes that such understanding is achieved via the integration of critical biological properties (e.g., faces, affect). In this study, we assessed the areas of the brain that were engaged when people interpreted and imagined moving shapes as animate or inanimate. Although observing and imagining the moving shapes engaged the mirror system, only activation of the social network was modulated by animacy.

AB We study call routing policies for call centers with multiple call types and multiple agent groups. We introduce new weight-based routing policies where each pair (call type, agent group) is given a matching priority defined as an affine combination of the longest waiting time for that call type and the longest idle time or the number of idle agents in that agent group. The coefficients in this combination are parameters to be optimized. This type of policy is more flexible than traditional ones found in practice, and it performs better in many situations. We consider objective functions that account for the service levels, the abandonment ratios, and the fairness of occupancy across agent groups. We select the parameters of all considered policies via simulation-based optimization heuristics. This requires only the availability of a simulation model of the call center, which can be much more detailed and realistic than the models used elsewhere in the literature to study the optimality of certain types of routing rules. We offer a first numerical study of realistic routing rules that takes into account the complexity of real-life call centers.

AB In this paper, we propose a statistical aggregation method for agent-based models with heterogeneous agents that interact both locally on a complex adaptive network and globally on a market. The method combines three approaches from statistical physics: (a) moment closure, (b) pair approximation of adaptive network processes, and (c) thermodynamic limit of the resulting stochastic process. As an example of use, we develop a stochastic agent-based model with heterogeneous households that invest in either a fossil-fuel- or renewables-based sector while allocating labor on a competitive market. Using the adaptive voter model, the model describes agents as social learners that interact on a dynamic network. We apply the approximation methods to derive a set of ordinary differential equations that approximate the macrodynamics of the model. A comparison of the reduced analytical model with numerical simulations shows that the approximation fits well for a wide range of parameters. The method makes it possible to use analytical tools to better understand the dynamical properties of models with heterogeneous agents on adaptive networks. We showcase this with a bifurcation analysis that identifies parameter ranges with multistabilities. The method can thus help to explain emergent phenomena from network interactions and make them mathematically traceable.

AB The United States is experiencing an epidemic of chronic disease. As the US population ages, health care providers and policy makers urgently need decision models that provide systematic, credible prediction regarding the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases to improve population health management and medical decision-making. Agent-based modeling is a promising systems science approach that can model complex interactions and processes related to chronic health conditions, such as adaptive behaviors, feedback loops, and contextual effects. This article introduces agent-based modeling by providing a narrative review of agent-based models of chronic disease and identifying the characteristics of various chronic health conditions that must be taken into account to build effective clinical- and policy-relevant models. We also identify barriers to adopting agent-based models to study chronic diseases. Finally, we discuss future research directions of agent-based modeling applied to problems related to specific chronic health conditions.

AB Insurance is critical to the fabric of modern societies and economies, but the insurance industry continues to suffer deep cycles and periodic crises. These have a great socio-economic cost as insurance cover can become prohibitively expensive or unavailable, damaging livelihoods, property, belongings and employment. These phenomena are poorly understood. A set of socio-anthropological and behavioural hypotheses have recently been posited. We investigate these explanations by means of an agent-based simulation model. The model is parameterized on actual property insurance industry data and is carefully validated. Our main result is that simple behaviour and interaction at the individual level can result in complex cyclical industry-wide behaviour. Heterogeneity and interaction at a micro level must therefore be understood if cycles and crises in the insurance industry are to be managed and prevented.

AB Surface topographical effects on the mechanical behavior of interlocking multi-stepped double scarf adhesive joints under tensile load were studied. For this purpose, finite element analysis (FEA) of the joint geometry at 10 different step angles was carried out. In the second stage, the effects of substrate voids and adhesive delaminations on the interfacial strength were studied for the scarf angle of 32.2 degrees by FEA simulation as well as experimentally. For the cases of the missing steps (voids) and delamination (absence of bonding induced by release agent) the ratios of maximum stresses (principal, von Mises, normal, shear and transverse) between the completely bonded and altered (void or delaminated) joints were compared with the failure load ratios for the same joints to interpret the mechanism of failure. The results revealed that except for the normal stress, the maximum stress ratios reach a maximum value and then decrease with increasing scarf angle. FEA analysis with the voids showed that the strength of the joint not only depends on their size, but also on their location in the joint When the experimental results were compared with the FEA using the stress ratio between the unmodified (completely bonded) and modified (void or disbond) cases, the results indicated that the normal stress dominates the failure behavior of the 32.2 degrees scarf angle joint Comparison of the experimental results for the void, and disbond cases revealed that the disbond cases can possess higher joint strength in comparison to the void cases. This finding could not be predicted by FEA, and was attributed to the presence of friction at the interface subsequent to delamination. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this article, we discuss different approaches and mechanisms implemented in the social force model regarding its role in obtaining real-life data. In crowd evacuation processes, preserving normal crowd density at an exit is crucial. Here, we introduce a new mechanism for the reproduction of specific flow rate within the range stated in the literature. For the implementation of this mechanism into the social force model, an association between the pedestrians' social responsibility to relieve any unusual crowd density in front of an exit and a reduction in their competition behavior is presented, where the pedestrians' perception of what is behind them is the main factor in this association. Accordingly, a model is proposed for rear perception subject to the production of the fundamental diagram and the specific flow rate, while conserving the interpedestrian dynamics by which the social force model is characterized. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the validity of this mechanism.

AB A recent challenge in life safety is to improve evacuee's performance using technology. Here we propose an intelligent evacuation guiding system for complex buildings. It uses information from fire protection systems, and calculates the optimal evacuation routes from real-time simulations to guide evacuees by dynamic signage through safest and fastest available paths. The proposed system was tested in a multi-enclosure building using participants. We found that 89% of participants followed the emergency exit signs. The reported results also indicate that the system may have a positive impact on evacuation time (reduced from 28.41% to 59.79% with the system). We also found that participants moved significantly faster when the system was in use. These findings support the hypothesis that, in practice, smart egress systems improve evacuation behaviour. Practical limitations of the tested system are discussed to define further research.

AB Supporting decision-making processes when the elements of a group are geographically dispersed and on a tight schedule is a complex task. Aiming to support decision-makers anytime and anywhere, Web-based group decision support systems have been studied. However, the limitations in the decision-makers' interactions associated to this scenario bring new challenges. In this work, we propose a set of behavioral styles from which decision-makers' intentions can be modelled into agents. The goal is that, besides having agents represent typical preferences of the decision-makers (towards alternatives and criteria), they can also represent their intentions. To do so, we conducted a survey with 64 participants in order to find homogeneous operating values so as to numerically define the proposed behavioral styles in four dimensions. In addition, we also propose a communication model that simulates the dialogues made by decision-makers in face-to-face meetings. We developed a prototype to simulate decision scenarios and found that agents are capable of acting according to the decision-makers' intentions and fundamentally benefit from different possible behavioral styles, just as a face-to-face meeting benefits from the heterogeneity of its participants.

AB This study provides a framework for understanding how population composition conditions the relationship between individuals' choices about group affiliation and aggregate patterns of social separation or integration. The substantive focus is the role of income inequality in racial residential segregation. The author identifies three population parameters-between-group inequality, within-group inequality, and relative group size-that determine how income inequality between race groups affects racial segregation. She uses data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to estimate models of individual-level residential mobility and incorporates these estimates into agent-based models. She then simulates segregation dynamics under alternative assumptions about (1) the relative size of minority groups and (2) the degree of correlation between race and income among individuals. The author finds that income inequality can have offsetting effects at the high and low ends of the income distribution. She demonstrates the empirical relevance of the simulation results using fixed-effects, metro-level regressions applied to 1980-2000 U. S. census data.

AB We present a generalization of the dynamical model of information transmission and herd behavior proposed by Eguiluz and Zimmermann, A characteristic size of group of agents s(0) is introduced. The fragmentation and coagulation rates of groups of' agents are assumed to depend on the size of the group. We present results of numerical simulations and mean field analysis, It is found that the size distribution of groups of agents n. exhibits two distinct scaling behavior depending on s less than or equal to s(0) or s > s(0). For s less than or equal to s(0), n(s) similar to s(-(5/2\delta)), while for to s(0),n(s) similar to s(-(5/2-delta)) where delta is a model parameter representing the sensitivity of the fragmentation and coagulation rates to the size of the group. Our model thus gkCS a tunable exponent f'or the size distribution together with two scaling regimes separated by a characteristic size s(0). Suitably interpreted, our model can be used to represent the formation of groups of customers for certain products produced by manufacturers. This, in turn, leads to a distribution in the size of' businesses. The characteristic sizes s(0), in this context. represents the size of a business for which the customer group becomes too large to be kept happy but too small for the business to become a brand name.

There are an optimization problem and two game-theoretical models when players as centers of influence aim to make the opinions of the agents closer to the target ones in a finite time horizon minimizing their costs. The optimization problem and the games of competition for the agents' opinion are linear-quadratic and solved using the Euler-equation approach. The optimal strategies for optimization problem and the Nash equilibria in the open-loop strategies for the games are found. Numerical simulations demonstrate theoretical results.

AB Mentalizing is defined as the inference of mental states of fellow humans, and is a particularly important skill for social interactions. Here we assessed whether activity in brain areas involved in mentalizing is specific to the processing of mental states or can be generalized to the inference of non-mental states by comparing brain responses during the interaction with an intentional and an artificial agent. Participants were scanned using fMRI during interactive rock-paper-scissors games while believing their opponent was a fellow human (Intentional agent, Int), a humanoid robot endowed with an artificial intelligence (Artificial agent, Art), or a computer playing randomly (Random agent, Rnd). Participants' subjective reports indicated that they adopted different stances against the three agents. The contract of brain activity during interaction with the artificial and the random agents didn't yield any cluster at the threshold used, suggesting the absence of a reproducible stance when interacting with an artificial intelligence. We probed response to the artificial agent in regions of interest corresponding to clusters found in the contrast between the intentional and the random agents. In the precuneus involved in working memory, the posterior intraparietal sulcus, in the control of attention and the dorsolaterial prefrontal cortex, in executive functions, brain activity for Art was larger than for Rnd but lower than for Int, supporting the intrinsically engaging nature of social interactions. A similar pattern in the left premotor cortex and anterior intraparietal sulcus involved in motor resonance suggested that participants simulated human, and to a lesser extend humanoid robot actions, when playing the game. Finally mentalizing regions, the medial prefrontal cortex and right temporoparietal junction, responded to the human only, supporting the specificity of mentalizing areas for interactions with intentional agents.

ID REVISION
AB This paper reports the first results of a simulation experiment. There are two databases, one containing true propositions and the other containing their respective negations. Five agents in turn access one of them. Each agent has a "capacity" that will be used as the frequency with which the agent accesses (unconsciously) the database with the correct knowledge. Agents randomly exchange information with the others. Since they have limited degrees of capacity, their "cognitive state" quickly becomes inconsistent. Each agent is equipped with the same belief revision mechanism to detect and solve these contradictions. This adopts the Dempster's Rule of Combination to evaluate the credibility of the various pieces of information and Bayesian Conditioning to estimate the relative degrees of reliability of the agents (itself included). The purpose of the experiments was that of evaluating on a statistical basis, the emergent cognitive behavior of the group.

ID MEAN-FIELD GAMES; LOGIT MODEL
AB We consider a class of dynamic collective choice models with social interactions, whereby a large number of nonuniform agents have to individually settle on one of multiple discrete alternative choices, with the relevance of their would-be choices continuously impacted by noise and the unfolding group behavior. This class of problems is modeled here as a so-called min-LQG game, i.e., a linear quadratic Gaussian dynamic and noncooperative game, with an additional combinatorial aspect in that it includes a final choice-related minimization in its terminal cost. The presence of this minimization term is key to enforcing some specific discrete choice by each individual agent. The theory of mean field games is invoked to generate a class of decentralized agent feedback control strategies, which are then shown to converge to an exact Nash equilibrium of the game as the number of players increases to infinity. A key building block in our approach is an explicit solution to the problem of computing the best response of a generic agent to some arbitrarily posited smooth mean field trajectory. Ultimately, an agent is shown to face a continuously revised discrete choice problem, where greedy choices dictated by current conditions must be constantly balanced against the risk of the future process noise upsetting the wisdom of such decisions. We show that any Nash equilibrium of the game is defined by an a priori computable probability matrix, which describes the distribution of the players' choices over the alternatives. The results are illustrated through simulations.

AB Although in many social sciences there is a radical division between studies based on quantitative ( e. g. statistical) and qualitative ( e. g. ethnographic) methodologies and their associated epistemological commitments, agent-based simulation fits into neither camp, and should be capable of modelling both quantitative and qualitative data. Nevertheless, most agent-based models (ABMs) are founded on quantitative data. This paper explores some of the methodological and practical problems involved in basing an ABM on qualitative participant observation and proposes some advice for modelers.

AB Our understanding of social insect behavior has significantly influenced artificial intelligence (AI) and multirobot systems research (e.g., ant algorithms and swarm robotics). in this work, however, we focus on the opposite question: "How can multirobot systems research contribute to the understanding of social. animal behavior?" AS we show, we are able to contribute at several levels. First, using algorithms that originated-in the robotics community, we can track animals under observation to provide essential quantitative data for animal behavior research. Second, by developing and applying algorithms originating in speech recognition and computer vision, we can automatically label the behavior of animals under observation. In some cases the automatic labeling is more accurate and consistent than manual behavior identification. our ultimate goal, however, is to automatically create, from observation, executable models of behavior. An executable model is a control program for an agent that can run in simulation (or on a robot). The representation for these executable models is drawn from research in multirobot systems programming. in this paper we present the algorithms we have developed for tracking, recognizing, and learning models of social animal behavior, details of their implementation, and quantitative experimental results using them to study social insects.

DT Article
ID COOPERATION; RECIPROCITY; CYCLES; RULES
AB Collective behaviors by self-organization are ubiquitous in nature and human society and extensive efforts have been made to explore the mechanisms behind them. Artificial intelligence (AI) as a rapidly developing field is of great potential for these tasks. By combining reinforcement learning with evolutionary game (RLEG), we numerically discover a rich spectrum of collective behaviors-explosive events, oscillation, and stable states, etc., that are also often observed in the human society. In this work, we aim to provide a theoretical framework to investigate the RLEGs systematically. Specifically, we formalize AI-agents' learning processes in terms of belief switches and behavior modes defined as a series of actions following beliefs. Based on the preliminary results in the time-independent environment, we investigate the stability at the mixed equilibrium points in RLEGs generally, in which agents reside in one of the optimal behavior modes. Moreover, we adopt the maximum entropy principle to infer the composition of agents residing in each mode at a strictly stable point. When the theoretical analysis is applied to the 2 x 2 game setting, we can explain the uncovered collective behaviors and are able to construct equivalent systems intuitively. Also, the inferred composition of different modes is consistent with simulations. Our work may be helpful to understand the related collective emergence in human society as well as behavioral patterns at the individual level and potentially facilitate human-computer interactions in the future.

AB Mathematical models for systems of interacting agents using simple local rules have been proposed and shown to exhibit emergent swarming behavior. Most of these models are constructed by intuition or manual observations of real phenomena, and later tuned or verified to simulate desired dynamics. In contrast to this approach, we propose using a model that attempts to follow an averaged rule of the essential distance-dependent collective behavior of real pigeon flocks, which was abstracted from experimental data. By using a simple model to follow the behavioral tendencies of real data, we show that our model can exhibit a wide range of emergent self-organizing dynamics such as flocking, pattern formation, and counter-rotating vortices.

AB The current excitation strategy for harmonic and subharmonic imaging (HI and SHI) uses short sine-bursts. However, alternate pulsing strategies may be useful for enhancing nonlinear emissions from ultrasound contrast agents. The goal of this study was to corroborate the hypothesis that chirp-coded excitation can improve the performance of high-frequency HI and SHI. A secondary goal was to understand the mechanisms that govern the response of ultrasound contrast agents to chirp-coded and sine-burst excitation schemes. Numerical simulations and acoustic measurements were conducted to evaluate the response of a commercial contrast agent (Targestar-P (R)) to chirp-coded and sine-burst excitation (10MHz frequency, peak pressures 290 kPa). The results of the acoustic measurements revealed an improvement in signal-to-noise ratio by 4 to 14 dB, and a two-to threefold reduction in the subharmonic threshold with chirp-coded excitation. Simulations conducted with the Marmottant model suggest that an increase in expansion-dominated radial excursion of microbubbles was the mechanism responsible for the stronger nonlinear response. Additionally, chirp-coded excitation detected the nonlinear response for a wider range of agent concentrations than sine-bursts. Therefore, chirp-coded excitation could be a viable approach for enhancing the performance of HI and SHI. (C) 2013 Acoustical Society of America.

AB Around the world today, the magnitude and rates of environmental, social, and economic change are undermining the sustainability of many rural societies that rely directly on natural resources for their livelihoods. Sustainable development efforts seek to promote livelihood adaptations that enhance food security and reduce social-ecological vulnerability, but these efforts are hampered by the difficulty of understanding the complexity and dynamism of rural livelihood systems. Disparate research avenues are strengthening our ability to grapple with complexity. But we are only just beginning to find ways to simultaneously account for problematic complexities, including multiscalar feedbacks in the ecosystems that that support livelihoods, the heterogeneous benefits garnered by different segments of society, and the complex contingencies that constrain people's decisions and capacities to adapt. To provide a more nuanced analysis of the dynamics of transformation in rural livelihood systems, we identified key complementarities between four different research approaches, enabling us to integrate them in a novel research framework that can guide empirical and modeling research on livelihood adaptation. The framework capitalizes upon parallel concepts of sequentiality in (1) ecosystem services and (2) livelihood adaptation scholarship, then incorporates principles from (3) adaptation in social-ecological systems research to account for the dynamism inherent in these often rapidly-transforming systems. Lastly, we include advances in (4) agent-based modeling, which couples human decisions and land use change and provides tools to incorporate complex social-ecological feedbacks in simulation studies of livelihood adaptation. Here we describe the new Ecosystem Services Livelihood Adaptation (ESLA) framework, explain how it links the contributing approaches, and illustrate its application with two case studies. We offer guidance for its implementation in empirical and modeling research, and conclude with a discussion of current challenges in sustainability science and the contributions that could be gained through research guided by the ESLA framework.

AB We explore the impact of travel information sharing on road networks using a two-layer, agent-based, day-to-day traffic network model. The first layer (cyber layer) represents a conceptual communication network where travel information is shared among drivers. The second layer (physical layer) captures the day-to-day evolution of a traffic network. Instead of having perfect information, the drivers are assumed to form groups, among which travel information is shared and utilized for routing decisions. The formation of groups occurs in the cyber layer according to the notion of percolation, which describes the formation of connected clusters in a random graph. The notion of percolation captures the disaggregated and distributed nature of travel information sharing. We present numerical studies on the convergence of the traffic network with a range of percolation rates. The findings suggest a positive correlation between the percolation rate and the speed of convergence, which is validated through statistical analysis.

AB We develop an empirical discrete-choice interaction model with a finite number of agents. We characterize its equilibrium properties-in particular the correspondence between interaction strength, number of agents, and the set of equilibria-and propose to estimate the model by means of simulation methods. In an empirical application, we analyze the individual behavior of high school teenagers in almost 500 school classes from 70 schools. In our baseline model endogenous social interaction effects are strong for behavior closely related to school (truancy), somewhat weaker for behavior partly related to school (smoking, cell phone ownership, and moped ownership) and absent for behavior far away from school (asking parents' permission for purchases). Intra-gender interactions are generally much stronger than cross-gender interactions. In a model with school-specific fixed effects social interaction effects are insignificant, with the exception of intra-gender interactions for truancy. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This chapter explores the methodological issues of modelling human behaviour at the relatively high abstraction level of the differences between individual-based and systems perspectives. Following earlier literature it will be argued that formal frameworks in the social sciences are essentially deductive, as they can be read as implications derived from a set of axioms, or postulates. However, in the social sciences implications derived from postulates do not necessarily have a one-to-one correspondence with empirical observations. This marks an important difference with the natural sciences, highlighted by the possibility in the social sciences of choosing one of several formal frameworks. Therefore, a criterion is needed for judging the explanatory value of a model.
   An attractive criterion, based on computer simulations using agent-based models, is the possibility of replicating a stylised version of an observed phenomenon. We argue that parallel to efforts taken in this direction, agent-based methods could also benefit from so-called serious games, where techniques from Artificial Intelligence in computer games are adapted for purposes other than entertainment.

AB Modeling a polity based on viable scientific concepts and theoretical understanding has been a challenge in computational social science and social simulation in general and political science in particular. This paper presents a computational model of a polity (political system) in progressive versions from simple to more realistic. The model, called SimPol to highlight the fundamental structures and processes of politics in a generic society, is developed using the combined methodologies of object-based modeling (OOM), the Unified Modeling Language (UML), and the methodology of Lakatos' research programs. SimPol demonstrates that computational models of entire political systems are methodologically feasible and scientifically viable; they can also build on and progress beyond previous theory and research to advance our understanding of how polities operate across a variety of domains (simple vs. complex) and levels of analysis (local, national, international). Both simple and realistic models are necessary, for theoretical and empirical purposes, respectively.

AB Computational models of human collective behavior offer promise in providing quantitative and empirically verifiable accounts of how individual decisions lead to the emergence of group-level organizations. Agent-based models (ABMs) describe interactions among individual agents and their environment, and provide a process-oriented alternative to descriptive mathematical models. Recent ABMs provide compelling accounts of group pattern formation, contagion and cooperation, and can be used to predict, manipulate and improve upon collective behavior. ABMs overcome an assumption that underlies much of cognitive science-that the individual is the crucial unit of cognition. The alternative advocated here is that individuals participate in collective organizations that they might not understand or even perceive, and that these organizations affect and are affected by individual behavior.

AB When engaging in social interaction, people rely on their ability to reason about unobservable mental content of others, which includes goals, intentions, and beliefs. This so-called theory of mind ability allows them to more easily understand, predict, and influence the behavior of others. People even use their theory of mind to reason about the theory of mind of others, which allows them to understand sentences like Alice believes that Bob does not know about the surprise party'. But while the use of higher orders of theory of mind is apparent in many social interactions, empirical evidence so far suggests that people do not use this ability spontaneously when playing strategic games, even when doing so would be highly beneficial. In this paper, we attempt to encourage participants to engage in higher-order theory of mind reasoning by letting them play a game against computational agents. Since previous research suggests that competitive games may encourage the use of theory of mind, we investigate a particular competitive game, the Mod game, which can be seen as a much larger variant of the well-known rock-paper-scissors game. By using a combination of computational agents and Bayesian model selection, we simultaneously determine to what extent people make use of higher-order theory of mind reasoning, as well as to what extent computational agents can encourage the use of higher-order theory of mind in their human opponents. Our results show that participants who play the Mod game against computational theory of mind agents adjust their level of theory of mind reasoning to that of their computer opponent. Earlier experiments with other strategic games show that participants only engage in low orders of theory of mind reasoning. Surprisingly, we find that participants who knowingly play against second- and third-order theory of mind agents apply up to fourth-order theory of mind themselves, and achieve higher scores as a result.

AB This paper presents an approach for solving the crowd navigation problem in an unknown and dynamic environment based on deep reinforcement learning. In our approach, we first make four leader agents learn how to reach their goals and avoid collisions with static and dynamic obstacles in an unknown environment by use of proximal policy optimization combined with Long short-term memory and a collision prediction algorithm. In the second stage, we make each leader agent arrive at a specific goal several times and record its trajectory as the guiding path so that the members in its group know how to reach their goals. We adopt the Reciprocal Velocity Obstacle algorithm to make agents not collide with others. Finally, we simulate the scenario of four groups moving towards their goals simultaneously using the Unity 3D engine. The experimental results demonstrate self-learning ability of a crowd who can reach their goals successfully in an unknown and dynamic environment.

AB To improve communication during emergencies, this research introduces an agent-based modeling (ABM) method to test the effect of psychological emergency communication strategies on evacuation performance. We follow a generative social science approach in which agent-based simulations allow for testing different candidate solutions. Unlike traditional methods, such as laboratory experiments and field observations, ABM simulation allows high-risk and infrequent scenarios to be empirically examined before applying the lessons in the real world. This is essential, as emergency communication with diverse crowds can be challenging due to language barriers, conflicting social identities, different cultural mindsets, and crowd demographics. Improving emergency communication could therefore improve evacuations, reduce injuries, and ultimately save lives. We demonstrate this ABM method by determining the effectiveness of three communication strategies for different crowd compositions in transport terminals: (1) dynamic emergency exit floor lighting directing people to exits, (2) staff guiding people to exits with verbal and physical instructions, and (3) public announcements in English. The simulation results indicated that dynamic emergency exit floor lighting and staff guiding people to exits were only beneficial for high-density crowds and those unfamiliar with the environment. Furthermore, English public announcements actually slowed the evacuation for mainly English-speaking crowds, due to simultaneous egress causing congestion at exits, but improved evacuation speed in multicultural, multilingual crowds. Based on these results, we make recommendations about which communication strategies to apply in the real world to demonstrate the utility of this ABM simulation approach for risk assessment practice.

AB The dynamics of opinions are seldom investigated in detail in public opinion research because of the difficulty in capturing long-term changes with classical empirical methods. Agent-based modeling (ABM) promises a solution for combining (structural) theories and temporally explicit models while also considering social interaction. In this paper we operationalize and formalize the theoretical assumptions of the social judgment theory concerning opinion changes. Moreover, to link the ABM to a real case, we investigated opinions on the contested infrastructure of deep geological repositories in Switzerland with a longitudinal online questionnaire. The questionnaire results serve as initialization data for the model. The simulation results show the agents' opinions in a disaggregated way and reveal their heterogeneous development over time. The implications for a successful research cycle comprising theorizing, modeling, and empirical data acquisition are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The analysis of the ship layout from the point of view of safe and orderly evacuation represents an important step in ship design, which can be carried out through agent-based evacuation simulation tools, typically run in batch mode. Introducing the possibility for humans to interactively participate in a simulated evacuation process together with computer-controlled agents can open a series of interesting possibilities for design, research and development. To this aim, this article presents the development of a validated agent-based evacuation simulation tool which allows real-time human participation through immersive virtual reality. The main characteristics of the underlying social-force-based modelling technique are described. The tool is verified and validated by making reference to International Maritime Organization test cases, experimental data and FDS + Evac simulations. The first approach for supporting real-time human participation is then presented. An initial experiment embedding immersive virtual reality human participation is described, together with outcomes regarding comparisons between human-controlled avatars and computer-controlled agents. Results from this initial testing are encouraging in pursuing the use of virtual reality as a tool to obtain information on human behaviour during evacuation.

AB We report a summary of our interdisciplinary research project Evolutionary Perspective on Collective Decision Making that was conducted through close collaboration between computational, organizational, and social scientists at Binghamton University. We redefined collective human decision making and creativity as evolution of ecologies of ideas, where populations of ideas evolve via continual applications of evolutionary operators such as reproduction, recombination, mutation, selection, and migration of ideas, each conducted by participating humans. Based on this evolutionary perspective, we generated hypotheses about collective human decision making, using agent-based computer simulations. The hypotheses were then tested through several experiments with real human subjects. Throughout this project, we utilized evolutionary computation (EC) in non-traditional ways(1) as a theoretical framework for reinterpreting the dynamics of idea generation and selection, (2) as a computational simulation model of collective human decision-making processes, and (3) as a research tool for collecting high-resolution experimental data on actual collaborative design and decision making from human subjects. We believe our work demonstrates untapped potential of EC for interdisciplinary research involving human and social dynamics.

AB Now that complex Agent-Based Models and computer simulations spread over economics and social sciences - as in most sciences of complex systems -, epistemological puzzles (re) emerge. We introduce new epistemological concepts so as to show to what extent authors are right when they focus on some empirical, instrumental or conceptual significance of their model or simulation. By distinguishing between models and simulations, between types of models, between types of computer simulations and between types of empiricity obtained through a simulation, section 2 gives the possibility to understand more precisely - and then to justify - the diversity of the epistemological positions presented in section 1. Our final claim is that careful attention to the multiplicity of the denotational powers of symbols at stake in complex models and computer simulations is necessary to determine, in each case, their proper epistemic status and credibility.

AB Potassium oleate (PO) is a promising inhibitor for cobalt wiring chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) of integrated circuit (IC) to replace benzotriazole (BTA). The insoluble Co-PO complex formed on cobalt surface in the process of CMP become the main organic residues object of post CMP cleaning. In this paper, tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) and three complexing agents with different functional groups were used to form alkaline cleaning solution to remove the organic residue of Co-PO complex on cobalt surface. The cleaning effect was characterized by contact angle, electrochemistry, atomic force microscope (AFM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Furthermore, the cleaning mechanism was revealed by molecular dynamics simulation based on density functional theory (DFT). The results show that the carboxyl group in Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) is more easily to chelate with Co(II), which could break the Co-PO complex to remove PO on the cobalt surface. The mechanism of removing corrosion inhibitors by complexing agents will be helpful to the post-CMP cleaning of new generation Cobalt wiring.

AB When making decisions, agents tend to make use of decisions others have made in similar situations. Ignoring this behavior in empirical models can be interpreted as a problem of omitted variables. We suggest a possibility of integrating such outside influences into models of discrete choice by defining an abstract social space in which agents with similar characteristics are neighbors who possibly influence each other. Monte Carlo simulations show the small sample properties of the proposed spatial binary choice model. When applying the estimator to innovation decisions data of German firms, we find evidence for the existence of neighborhood effects. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We present a flexible initial framework for defining self-motivated, self-aware agents in simulated worlds, planning continuously so as to maximize long-term rewards. While such agents employ reasoned exploration of feasible sequences of actions and corresponding states, they also behave opportunistically and recover from failure, thanks to their continual plan updates and quest for rewards. Our framework allows for both specific and general (quantified) knowledge and for epistemic predicates such as knowing-that and knowing-whether. Because realistic agents have only partial knowledge of their world, the reasoning of the proposed agents uses a weakened closed-world assumption; this has consequences for epistemic reasoning, in particular introspection. The planning operators allow for quantitative, gradual change and side effects such as the passage of time, changes in distances and rewards, and language production, using a uniform procedural attachment method. Question answering (involving introspection) and experimental runs are shown for our particular agent ME in a simple world, demonstrating the value of continual deliberate, reward-driven planning. Though the primary merit of agents definable in our framework is that they combine all of the aforementioned features, they can also be configured as single or multiple goal-seeking agents and as such perform comparably with some recent experimental agents.

AB We are part of a multi-disciplinary team investigating new understandings of stem cell behaviour, and specifically looking novel ideas about how adult stem cells behave and organise themselves in the human body. We have used different methods and mechanisms for investigating and interpreting these new ideas from medical science. These have included mathematical modelling, simulation and visualisation as well as a series of art pieces that have resulted from looking at the overall nature of our combined multi-disciplinary attempt to investigate new theories of biological organisation. In this paper we look at several issues relating to our project. First, we provide reasons for why formal models and simulations are needed to explore this growing area of research. Is there an argument to suggest that we need simulations as a way in to understanding various properties of stem cells that are observed in wet lab experiments? Next, an introduction on current theoretical models of stem cells is presented along with an outline of some of the problems and limitations of these approaches. We then provide an overview of our agent-based model of stem cells, and discuss strategies for implementing this model as a simulation and its subsequent visualisation. Then we discuss the role of the artist (the second author) in developing our model and simulation and the influence of the artwork/exhibition on the other members in our team. Our premise is that artists can conceptualise scientific theories without the standard discipline-specific constraints, and thereby potentially influence the development of scientific theories, their mathematical formulation; and their associated aesthetics. Finally, we argue that for the field of bioinformatics to move forward in a holistic and cohesive manner more multi-disciplinary efforts such as ours would be of significant benefit to this research area [20]. This paper might be viewed as an advert for the benefits of multi-disciplinary teams in understanding new experimental data in medicine and biology.

AB The well-known Ising model used in statistical physics was adapted to a social dynamics context to simulate the adoption of a technological innovation. The model explicitly combines (a) an individual's perception of the advantages of an innovation and (b) social influence from members of the decision-maker's social network. The micro-level adoption dynamics are embedded into an agent-based model that allows exploration of macro-level patterns of technology diffusion throughout systems with different configurations (number and distributions of early adopters, social network topologies). In the present work we carry out many numerical simulations. We find that when the gap between the individual's perception of the options is high, the adoption speed increases if the dispersion of early adopters grows. Another test was based on changing the network topology by means of stochastic connections to a common opinion reference (hub), which resulted in an increment in the adoption speed. Finally, we performed a simulation of competition between options for both regular and small world networks. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Distributed agent-based simulation is a popular method to realize computational experiment on large-scale artificial society. Meanwhile, the partitioning strategy of the artificial society models among hosts is playing an essential role for simulation engine to offer high execution efficiency as it has great impact on the communication overheads and computational load-balancing during simulation. Aiming at the problem, we firstly analyze the execution and scheduling process of agents during simulation and model it as wide-sense cyclostationary random process. Then, a static statistical partitioning model is proposed to obtain the optimal partitioning strategy with minimum average communication cost and load imbalance factor. To solve the static statistical partitioning model, this paper turns it into a graph-partitioning problem. A statistical movement graph-based partitioning algorithm is then devised which generates task graph model by mining the statistical movement information from initialization data of simulation model. In the experiments, two other popular partitioning methods are used to evaluate the performance of proposed graph-partitioning algorithm. Furthermore, this paper compares the graph-partitioning performance under different task graph model. The results indicate that our proposed statistical movement graph-based static partitioning method outperforms all other methods in reducing the communication overhead while satisfying the load balance constraint.

AB Currently, the combination of photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as a powerful technique for cancer treatment. However, most examples of combined PTT and PDT reported use multi-component nanocomposites under excitation of separate wavelength, resulting in complex treatment process. In this work, a novel theranostic nanoplatform (SiNcOH-DSPE-PEG(NH2) NPs) has been successfully developed by coating silicon 2,3-naphthalocyanine dihydroxide (SiNcOH) with DSPE-PEG and DSPE-PEG-NH2 for photoacoustic (PA) imaging-guided PIT and PDT tumor ablation for the first time. The as-prepared single-agent SiNcOH-DSPE-PEG(NH2) NPs not only have good water solubility and biocompatibility, but also exhibit high photothermal conversion efficiency and singlet oxygen generation capability upon 808 nm NIR laser irradiation. In addition, owing to their high absorption at NIR region, the SiNcOH-DSPE-PEG(NH2) NPs can also be employed as an effective diagnostic nanoagent for photoacoustic (PA) imaging. In vitro and in vivo experimental results clearly indicated that the simultaneously combined PTT and PDT under the guidance of PA imaging with single NIR laser excitation can effectively kill cancer cells or eradicate tumor tissues. Taking facile synthesis and high efficiency in cancer treatment by SiNcOH-DSPE-PEG(NH2) NPs into consideration, our study provides a promising strategy to realize molecular imaging-guided combination therapy.

ID MODEL
AB Recently it has been suggested that low fertility countries may be caught in a trap that is hard to get out of. One important mechanism in such a trap would be social interaction and its effect on the ideal family size. Such social interaction mechanisms are hard to capture in formal models, therefore we use an agent-based simulation model to investigate the issue. In our experimental setup a stable growth and population path is calibrated to Swedish data using the Swedish social policy setup. The model is provoked into a fertility trap by increasing relative child costs linked to positive growth. Even rather large increases in child benefits are then insufficient to get out of the trap. However, the small number of children temporarily enables the economy to grow faster for several decades. Removing the adaptation of social norms turns out to disarm the trap.

AB Background: The ActualHCA T system continuously monitors the activity, temperature and behavior of group-housed rats without invasive surgery. The system was validated to detect the contrasting effects of sedative and stimulant test agents (chlorpromazine, clonidine and amphetamine), and compared with the modified Irwin test (mIT) with rectal temperature measurements.
   Methods: Six male Han Wistar rats per group were used to assess each test agent and vehicle controls in separate ActualHCA T recordings and mIT. The mIT was undertaken at 15, 30 mins, 1, 2, 4 and 24 h post-dose. ActualHCA T recorded continuously for 24 h post-dose under 3 experimental conditions: dosed during light phase, dark phase, and light phase with a scheduled cage change at the time of peak effects determined by mIT.
   Results: ActualHCA T detected an increase stimulated activity from the cage change at 1-2 h post-dose which was obliterated by chlorpromazine and clonidine. Amphetamine increased activity up to 4 h post-dose in all conditions. Temperature from ActualHCA T was affected by all test agents in all conditions. The mIT showed effects on all 3 test agents up to 4 h post-dose, with maximal effects at 1-2 h post-dose. The maximal effects on temperature from ActualHCA T differed from mIT. Delayed effects on activity were detected by ActualHCA T, but not on mIT.
   Conclusions: Continuous monitoring has the advantage of capturing effects over time that may be missed with manual tests using pre-determined time points. This automated behavioural system does not replace the need for conventional methods but could be implemented simultaneously to improve our understanding of behavioural pharmacology.

AB Purpose: Understanding how to mitigate the present black white obesity disparity in the United States is a complex issue, stemming from a multitude of intertwined causes. An appropriate but underused approach to guiding policy approaches to this problem is to account for this complexity using simulation modeling.
   Methods: We explored the efficacy of a policy that improved the quality of neighborhood schools in reducing racial disparities in obesity-related behavior and the dependence of this effect on social network influence and norms. We used an empirically grounded agent-based model to generate simulation experiments. We used a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design that represented the presence or absence of improved neighborhood school quality, the presence or absence of social influence, and the type of social norm (healthy or unhealthy). Analyses focused on time trends in sociodemographic variables and diet quality.
   Results: First, the quality of schools and social network influence had independent and interactive effects on diet behavior. Second, the black white disparity in diet behavior was considerably reduced under some conditions, but never completely eliminated. Third, the degree to which the disparity in diet behavior was reduced was a function of the type of social norm that was in place; the reduction was the smallest when the type of social norm was healthy.
   Conclusions: Improving school quality can reduce, but not eliminate racial disparities in obesity-related behavior, and the degree to which this is true depends partly on social network effects. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID MAASAI; WORLD
AB Need-based transfers (NBTs) are actions to compensate losses after disasters. This form of risk pooling consists of connected individuals in a social network transferring wealth from those above a threshold, e.g. welfare threshold, to individuals below threshold in order to preserve the recipient's viable participation in the economy. Such systems are of interest to researchers ranging from evolutionary biologists studying the food sharing of bats to anthropologists studying the gifting of cattle among pastoral societies or mutual help arrangements among ranchers. In this paper, the comprehensive impact of transfer organization and network evolution is studied using agent-based simulations. It is found that in the short-term an optimal transfer rule is similar to a regressive cutting-stock optimization heuristic; however, such a rule has detrimental long-term impact as it leads to a vulnerable wealth distribution. Thus an optimal transfer scheme should both efficiently execute immediate disaster recovery and establish a secure wealth distribution. Also, the most successful network evolution model is one that encourages low variance in the node degrees, leading to equal sharing of the risk and benefit of such an NBT insurance relationship. These results provide a motivated guidance for empirical studies of existing NBT practices and suggestions for optimal implementation of similar resource management in volatile environments.

AB In this paper, a biomechanical crowd-structure interaction model is proposed and further implemented to adequately estimate the energy exchange between pedestrians and a footbridge. The proposed model focuses on the vibrations in the vertical direction, and it allows for taking into account the change of the modal properties of the structure due to the presence of the pedestrians, thus improving the numerical estimation of the response of the structure under pedestrian flows. The model involves two submodels, namely (1) a pedestrian-structure interaction submodel and (2) a crowd submodel. The first submodel follows from a modal projection of a system with two degrees of freedom, which simulates the behavior of each pedestrian, on the vibration modes of the structure. The parameters of this model have been estimated from the accelerations recorded on a real footbridge. For the second submodel, the crowd behavior is simulated via a multiagent method. The performance of the resulting overall model is assessed by correlating the experimental and numerical dynamic of a real footbridge under a group of pedestrians at different controlled step frequencies. In particular, the change in the first natural frequency induced by the pedestrian-footbridge interaction is discussed in detail. The proposed model leads to numerical results that exhibit good agreement with the recorded experimental values. Therefore, it becomes a valuable tool for estimating the change on the modal properties of a footbridge induced by the crowd-structure interaction phenomenon.

ID SOCIAL FORCE MODEL
AB In this paper, we propose a method for using particle swarm optimization (PSO) to compute optimal guidance paths for various crowd densities in an agent-based crowd simulation. The inputs of our system are guidance paths that provide hints for the movement directions of agents. Input guidance paths may not be located correctly (e.g., leading to congestion or high traveling cost); therefore, our method adjusts the guidance paths by using PSO. We consider several factors for evaluating the quality of a guidance path, including the average traveling time and interaction distance between agents. We apply our method in several examples. Experimental results show that our method can compute adaptive guidance paths for various crowd densities. Our system can simulate organized crowds that move in directions specified by the guidance paths. Copyright (c) 2015John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB To produce micro- or nano-sized particles of a solid solute drug, it is necessary to investigate their solubility behavior in supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2). In this study, for the first time, solubility of Oxcarbazepine (as anticonvulsant agent) in SC-CO2 was determined using static method. For this purpose, experiments were performed at different operating temperatures (308-338 K) and pressures (120-270 bar), and feasible molar solubilities were found to range from 1.100 x 10(-7) to 2.675 x 10(-5). Three different groups of methods were applied to correlate the solubility data of Oxcarbazepine, including (1) two equations of state (EoSs), namely Peng-Robinson (PR) and PRSV equation of state (vdW2 mixing rules), (2) six density-based semi-empirical models, namely Sodeifian et al., Chrastil, Bartle et al., Garlapati et al., Mendez-Santiago and Teja (MST), and Kumar and Johnston (K-J), and (3) Wilson's model. Statistical analysis of the results revealed superiority of Peng-Robinson model over the other models. Experimental data consistency was performed on various semi empirical models. Finally, the approximate values of total (Delta H-total), vaporization (Delta H-vap), and solvation (Delta H-sol) enthalpies were calculated for OXC. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Local opinion heterogeneity (LOH) critically influences an individual's choice of collective behaviors, such as voting and protesting. However, several empirical studies have presented different conclusions on how LOH affects such preference. In the current research, the effect of LOH is considered based on agent-based modeling and the threshold model introduced by Granovetter (1978). A series of simulation experiments and statistical analyses are conducted. Results show that LOH has an inverse U-shape effect on the likelihood of participation (whether an individual decides to participate). By contrast, the findings reveal that LOH has a monotonous effect on participation timing (when a participant makes the decision). Specifically, when LOH is high, an individual opts to participate early. These observations can be explained by the influence of LOH on the structure of social networks and by the moderating effect of the global distribution of opinions within the population.

AB Capillary flow through discrete cracks is the main mechanism by which healing agents embedded in cementitious matrices travel to zones of damage to afford the host matrix a healing ability. However, the nature of the interaction between the healing agents in their fluid state and the host matrix is unknown and may limit the ability to predict the behavior and efficacy of self-healing systems. This study considered the capillary flow characteristics of a low-viscosity cyanoacrylate and ground granulated blast furnace slag in a water suspension using glass capillaries and channels formed from a range of concrete mixes. Both healing agents conformed closely to Poiseuille's law and experienced increases in viscosity over the 40-min period that they were exposed to a cementitious environment. Numerical simulations of the capillary rise response of the healing agents in a discrete crack confirmed that the rate of damage and degree of saturation of the concrete element have a significant influence on the choice of healing agent in the design of self-healing systems.

AB Aim to discuss whether the contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) can effectively monitor the efficacy on neoadjuvant chemotherapy of breast cancer or not by analyzing the indicators on chemotherapy CEUS and breast cancer tumor biology, especially tumor microcirculation indicator on animal mode. Human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 are planted under the skins of nude mice. By simulating clinical neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen periodically inject CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and fluorouracil) into the experimental group, and normal saline into the control group. Then detect the data from CEUS and record the parameters: maximum intensity (IMAX), rise time (RT), time to peak (TTP) and mean transit time (mTT). Execute animal after CEUS, obtain tumor biological indicator and record parameters: micro vessel density (MVD), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1/2/3/4 (VEGFR-1/2/3/4) and tumor cells. In the aspect of tumor biological indicator, the experimental group after the first drug delivery: inter- and intra-group comparisons of VEGFR-1/4drop significantly. The experimental group after the second drug delivery: inter and intra-group comparisons of MVD, VEGFR-1/3/4drop significantly. In the aspect of parameters on tumor CEUS, the experimental group after the first drug delivery: inter- and intra-group comparisons of IMAX drop significantly. The experimental group after the second drug delivery: inter- and intra-group comparisons of IMAX decrease steeply; while inter-and intra-group comparisons of TTP rise significantly. There are great changes about the intra-group comparisons of the number of tumor cells before and after the experiment. In the process of chemotherapy, it maintains the consistency of the changes of CEUS parameters IMAX and TTP, tumor microcirculation indicators MVD and VEGFR-1/3/4 and tumor cells. So CEUS has a potential to make an early prediction on the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

AB Irrigation with surface water enables Chilean agricultural producers to generate one of the country's most important economic exports. The Chilean water code established tradable water rights as a mechanism to allocate water amongst farmers and other water-use sectors. It remains contested whether this mechanism is effective and many authors have raised equity concerns regarding its impact on water users. For example, speculative hoarding of water rights in expectations of their increasing value has been described. This paper demonstrates how farmers can hoard water rights as a risk management strategy for variable water supply, for example, due to the cycles of El Nino or as consequence of climate change. While farmers with insufficient water rights can rely on unclaimed water during conditions of normal water availability, drought years overproportionally impact on their supply of irrigation water and thereby farm profitability. This study uses a simulation model that consists of a hydrological balance model component and a multiagent farm decision and production component. Both model components are parameterized with empirical data, while uncertain parameters are calibrated. The study demonstrates a thorough quantification of parameter uncertainty, using global sensitivity analysis and multiple behavioral parameter scenarios.

DE Science of cyber security; Signaling games; Deception
AB We present a game theoretic framework that models strategic interactions among humans and things that are assumed to be interconnected by a social-technological network, as in an internet of humans and things (IOHT). Often a pair of agents in the network interacts in order for an informed sender-agent to signal an uninformed receiver-agent to take an action that benefits each of the players; the benefits to the pair of agents are modeled by two separate utility functions, both depending on the sender's private information, the signal exchanged, and the receiver's revealed (and also possibly unrevealed) action. In general, the two agents' utilities may not be aligned and may encourage deceptive behavior. For example, a sender, aware of his/her own private "state of ignorance", may seek useful information from a receiver who owns powerful computational resources to search a large corpus of webpages; the sender does so by sending a signal to the receiver in the form of a keyword. Obvious examples of deceptiveness here range from attempts to hide one's intentions to auctioning the keywords on an ad exchange through real-time bidding. A rather troublesome situation occurs when deceptions are employed to breach the security of the system, thus making the entire social-technological network unreliable. Earlier, we proposed a signaling-game-theoretic framework to alleviate this problem. This paper further enhances that framework by reconfiguring signals to possess more complex structures (epistatic signals to represent attack and defense options over a given set of vulnerabilities). We explore two augmentations to the original evolutionary signaling game by first enhancing mutation bias toward strategies performing well in previous populations and second allowing the parameters of the utility functions to depend on population preferences giving rise to a minority game with epistatic signaling. The resulting game systems are empirically studied through extensive computer simulation.

AB Background: Virtual reality (VR) is increasingly used as simulation technology in emergency medicine education and training, in particular for training nontechnical skills. Experimental studies comparing teaching and learning in VR with traditional training media often demonstrate the equivalence or even superiority regarding particular variables of learning or training effectiveness.
   Objective: In the EPICSAVE (Enhanced Paramedic Vocational Training with Serious Games and Virtual Environments) project, a highly immersive room-scaled multi-user 3-dimensional VR simulation environment was developed. In this feasibility study, we wanted to gain initial insights into the training effectiveness and media use factors influencing learning and training in VR.
   Methods: The virtual emergency scenario was anaphylaxis grade III with shock, swelling of the upper and lower respiratory tract, as well as skin symptoms in a 5-year-old girl (virtual patient) visiting an indoor family amusement park with her grandfather (virtual agent). A cross-sectional, one-group pretest and posttest design was used to evaluate the training effectiveness and quality of the training execution. The sample included 18 active emergency physicians.
   Results: The 18 participants rated the VR simulation training positive in terms of training effectiveness and quality of the training execution. A strong, significant correlation (r=.53, P=.01) between experiencing presence and assessing training effectiveness was observed. Perceived limitations in usability and a relatively high extraneous cognitive load reduced this positive effect.
   Conclusions: The training within the virtual simulation environment was rated as an effective educational approach. Specific media use factors appear to modulate training effectiveness (ie, improvement through "experience of presence" or reduction through perceived limitations in usability). These factors should be specific targets in the further development of this VR simulation training.

AB Innovation diffusion has been studied extensively in a variety of disciplines, including sociology, economics, marketing, ecology, and computer science. Traditional literature on innovation diffusion has been dominated by models of aggregate behavior and trends. However, the agent-based modeling (ABM) paradigm is gaining popularity as it captures agent heterogeneity and enables fine-grained modeling of interactions mediated by social and geographic networks. While most ABM work on innovation diffusion is theoretical, empirically grounded models are increasingly important, particularly in guiding policy decisions. We present a critical review of empirically grounded agent-based models of innovation diffusion, developing a categorization of this research based on types of agent models as well as applications. By connecting the modeling methodologies in the fields of information and innovation diffusion, we suggest that the maximum likelihood estimation framework widely used in the former is a promising paradigm for calibration of agent-based models for innovation diffusion. Although many advances have been made to standardize ABM methodology, we identify four major issues in model calibration and validation, and suggest potential solutions.

AB One-shot interaction and repeated interaction often co-exist in the real world. We study possible behavioral effects of this co-existence in a principal-agent setting, in which a principal simultaneously employs a permanent and a temporary agent. Our experimental results indicate that there is "discrimination" between the two agents and that the available information for agents determines the extent of this discrimination, even though the theoretical solution of the game implies equal treatment of agents. Discrimination is, thus, a consequence of reciprocity. Agents that are discriminated against react negatively by withholding effort. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This editorial introduces the special feature on the social-ecological system of a fire-prone forest landscape in Oregon, USA. Research into social-ecological systems of fire-frequent landscapes is in its infancy and this special feature highlights one of the first attempts to understand a fire-dependent forest landscape from this perspective. An agent-based landscape modeling framework, Envision, was the primary tool for the research. The papers in this special feature examine three major questions: (1) What is the landscape structure of forest conditions, fire regimes, ownerships, and attitudes toward fire and forest management?; (2) How are social networks of the study region structured and how might they influence attitudes and actions of landowners?; (3) How do land management policies, institutions, and decisions interact to influence future fire occurrence, biodiversity, and ecosystem services? The findings of the empirical research and simulation modeling reveal how the high ecological and social (e.g., landownership and management goals) diversity of the region contributes to very different fire potentials, attitudes, and management approaches across space. The social network analysis reveals that the social network is divided into fire protection and fire restoration subnetworks that only a few organizations were able to bridge. The simulation modeling shows how difficult it can be to affect fire behavior across large areas, and what the trade-offs of different management actions might be in terms of ecosystem services and fire risk. The special feature also includes papers that examine how social science research is influenced by the use of an agent-based model, and what has been learned about the process of conducting social-ecological research and engaging with stakeholders with the goal of improving understanding of and adaptation to fire-frequent landscapes.

AB The rapid and reliable detection of pathogenic microorganisms is an important issue for the safety and security of our society. Here we describe the use of a sensitive, inexpensive, amperometric, phage-based biosensor for the detection of extremely low concentrations of Bacillus cereus and Allycobacterium smegmatis as models for Bacillus anthracis (the causative agent of anthrax) and for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (the causative agent of tuberculosis), respectively. The detection procedure developed here enabled the determination of bacteria at a low concentration of 10 viable cells/mL within 8 h. This experimental setup allows the simultaneous analysis of up to eight independent samples, using disposable screen-printed electrodes. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The transition from fuel cars to electric cars is a large-scale process involving many interactions between consumers and other stakeholders over decades. To explore how policies may interact with consumer behavior over such a long time period, we developed an agent-based social simulation model. In this model, detailed data of 1795 respondents have been used to parameterise an agent architecture that addresses different consumer needs and decision strategies. Numerical experiments indicate that effective policy requires a long-lasting implementation of a combination of monetary, structural and informational measures. The strongest effect on emission reduction requires an exclusive support for full battery electric cars and no support for hybrid cars. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Management of multiple sclerosis (MS) is based on the usage of immunosuppressive and immune-modulating medications. Cytokines play an important role in the pathogenesis of MS. Objective: To evaluate the effects of rapamycin on the concentrations of Th1/Th2/Th17 serum cytokines in patients with MS. Methods: Six patients with relapsing remitting MS as a case group and 6 healthy individuals as a control group were enrolled. The patients have been receiving 2 mg rapamycin daily for 6 months. The individuals in control group received nothing during 6 months of the experiment. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (Simultaneous Multi-Analyte ELISA) technique was used for determination of serum concentrations of IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, G-CSF and TGF-beta before and after therapy with rapamycin. Results: The mean absorbance of 10 out of the 12 studied cytokines showed reduction after the therapy with rapamycin including IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. The only statistically significant reduction was observed in the absorbance of IFN-gamma (p=0.028). Two cytokines illustrated increase in the patients sera after the therapy, including G-CSF and TGF-beta, but only increase in TGF-beta was statistically significant (p=0.046). None of the studied cytokines in the control group varied significantly after 6 months. Conclusion: Based on the findings of this study, rapamycin has some immunosuppressive effects, such as decreasing IFN-gamma, which can improve the quality of life of the patients with multiple sclerosis. Also the increased level of TGF-beta may also have benefits on the disease, which needs further clinical studies.

ID CROWD
AB Under the circumstances of natural disasters or anthropogenic hazards, the crowd inside large-occupancy facilities needs to be evacuated. The goal of evacuation plans is to safely evacuate a crowd as fast as possible. But there is need for an accurate estimate of the total evacuation time and bottleneck occurrences. This study presents an innovative simulation methodology and algorithm with modified parameters intended to improve the simulation and analysis of the evacuations methods used in stadiums. The evacuation simulations are categorized according to the types of emergent situations and the number of evacuees. Each simulation is validated based on real-time data collected through observations and published literature. Dijkstra's algorithm is reconstructed using modified parameters, i.e., revised triangular distribution and normal distribution for walking speeds and empirical distribution for crowd behaviors. The simulation results demonstrate that the P-values of the system with normal distribution will yield statistically better equivalencies than those of triangular distribution. The results will help designers in analyzing evacuation design with enhanced confidence in total evacuation time and bottleneck prediction. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB Neonicotinoids are a globally prevalent class of pesticides that can negatively affect bees and the pollination services they provide. While there is evidence suggesting that colony size may play an important role inmitigating neonicotinoid exposure in bees, mechanisms underlying these effects are not well understood. Here, a recently developed agent-based computational model is used to investigate how the effects of sub-lethal neonicotinoid exposure on intranest behavior of bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) are modulated by colony size. Simulations from the model, parameterized using empirical data on bumblebee workers exposed to imidacloprid (a common neonicotinoid pesticide), suggest that colony size has significant effects on neonicotinoid-sensitivity within bumblebee nests. Specifically, differences are reduced between treated and untreated workers in larger colonies for several key aspects of behavior within nests. Our results suggest that changes in both number of workers and nest architecture may contribute to making larger colonies less sensitive to pesticide exposure.

AB Activity-based models in transportation science focus on the description of human trips and activities. Modeling the spatial decision for so-called secondary activities is addressed in this paper. Given both home and work locations, where do individuals perform activities such as shopping and leisure? Simulation of these decisions using random utility models requires a full enumeration of possible outcomes. For large data sets, it becomes computationally unfeasible because of the combinatorial complexity. To overcome that limitation, a model is proposed in which agents have limited, accurate information about a small subset of the overall spatial environment. Agents are interconnected by a social network through which they can exchange information. This approach has several advantages compared with the explicit simulation of a standard random utility model: (a) it computes plausible choice sets in reasonable computing times, (b) it can be extended easily to integrate further empirical evidence about travel behavior, and (c) it provides a useful framework to study the propagation of any newly available information. This paper emphasizes the computational efficiency of the approach for real-world examples.

AB The distribution of cultural variants in a population is shaped by both neutral evolutionary dynamics and by selection pressures. The temporal dynamics of social network connectivity, that is, the order in which individuals in a population interact with each other, has been largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate how, in a fully connected social network, connectivity dynamics, alone and in interaction with different cognitive biases, affect the evolution of cultural variants. Using agent-based computer simulations, we manipulate population connectivity dynamics (early, mid, and late full-population connectivity); content bias, or a preference for high-quality variants; coordination bias, or whether agents tend to use self-produced variants (egocentric bias), or to switch to variants observed in others (allocentric bias); and memory size, or the number of items that agents can store in their memory. We show that connectivity dynamics affect the time-course of variant spread, with lower connectivity slowing down convergence of the population onto a single cultural variant. We also show that, compared to a neutral evolutionary model, content bias accelerates convergence and amplifies the effects of connectivity dynamics, while larger memory size and coordination bias, especially egocentric bias, slow down convergence. Furthermore, connectivity dynamics affect the frequency of high-quality variants (adaptiveness), with late connectivity populations showing bursts of rapid change in adaptiveness followed by periods of relatively slower change, and early connectivity populations following a single-peak evolutionary dynamic. We evaluate our simulations against existing data collected from previous experiments and show how our model reproduces the empirical patterns of convergence.

TI Bayesian group sequential enrichment designs based on adaptive
   regression of response and survival time on baseline biomarkers

DT Article; Early Access
DE adaptive enrichment design; clinical trial; joint variable selection;
   piecewise exponential distribution
AB Precision medicine relies on the idea that, for a particular targeted agent, only a subpopulation of patients is sensitive to it and thus may benefit from it therapeutically. In practice, it is often assumed based on preclinical data that a treatment-sensitive subpopulation is known, and moreover that the agent is substantively efficacious in that subpopulation. Due to important differences between preclinical settings and human biology, however, data from patients treated with a new targeted agent often show that one or both of these assumptions are false. This paper provides a Bayesian randomized group sequential enrichment design that compares an experimental treatment to a control based on survival time and uses early response as an ancillary outcome to assist with adaptive variable selection and enrichment. Initially, the design enrolls patients under broad eligibility criteria. At each interim decision, submodels for regression of response and survival time on a baseline covariate vector and treatment are fit; variable selection is used to identify a covariate subvector that characterizes treatment-sensitive patients and determines a personalized benefit index, and comparative superiority and futility decisions are made. Enrollment of each cohort is restricted to the most recent adaptively identified treatment-sensitive patients. Group sequential decision cutoffs are calibrated to control overall type I error and account for the adaptive enrollment restriction. The design provides a basis for precision medicine by identifying a treatment-sensitive subpopulation, if it exists, and determining whether the experimental treatment is superior to the control in that subpopulation. A simulation study shows that the proposed design reliably identifies a sensitive subpopulation, yields much higher generalized power compared to several existing enrichment designs and a conventional all-comers group sequential design, and is robust.

AB A new application of polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) as coupling agents to functionalize conventional carbon fibers was reported. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and dynamic contact angle analysis were used to characterize the carbon fiber surface. AFM images showed that POSS was grafted uniformly on the fiber surface and the surface roughness increased significantly. XPS and FTIR results indicated that polar groups on the fiber surface increased after modification. Dynamic contact angle measurements, before and after functionalization, demonstrated an improvement in the surface energy and wettability that related to the increase of the polarity of the modified fiber surface. Single fiber pull-out testing, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and impact testing were carried out to evaluate the effect of the POSS coupling agent on the mechanical properties of the composites. Experimental results indicated that the interfacial strength under both static and dynamic loads had a dramatic improvement, and the impact toughness was increased simultaneously. Moreover, reinforcing and toughening mechanisms of the POSS coupling agent were also discussed.

AB In this contribution we aim at anchoring Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) simulations in actual models of human psychology. More specifically, we apply unidirectional ABM to social psychological models using low level agents (i.e., intra-individual) to examine whether they generate better predictions, in comparison to standard statistical approaches, concerning the intentions of performing a behavior and the behavior. Moreover, this contribution tests to what extent the predictive validity of models of attitude such as the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) or Model of Goal-directed Behavior (MGB) depends on the assumption that peoples' decisions and actions are purely rational. Simulations were therefore run by considering different deviations from rationality of the agents with a trembling hand method. Two data sets concerning respectively the consumption of soft drinks and physical activity were used. Three key findings emerged from the simulations. First, compared to standard statistical approach the agent-based simulation generally improves the prediction of behavior from intention. Second, the improvement in prediction is inversely proportional to the complexity of the underlying theoretical model. Finally, the introduction of varying degrees of deviation from rationality in agents' behavior can lead to an improvement in the goodness of fit of the simulations. By demonstrating the potential of ABM as a complementary perspective to evaluating social psychological models, this contribution underlines the necessity of better de. ning agents in terms of psychological processes before examining higher levels such as the interactions between individuals.

AB The analysis addresses two critical gaps in the literature on low-carbon mobility transitions: 1) scenarios of low-carbon mobility concentrate on technological substitution and have only a limited representation of niche-regime interactions and behavioural change, and 2) detailed qualitative analysis of socio-technical transitions dynamics have limited utility in developing future projections. It applies the Multi-Level Perspective on transitions, combining case studies of mobility niches in the Netherlands with simulations of transitions pathways using the MATISSE model, by applying the bridging approach proposed by Turnheim et al. (2015a). The iterative, combined qualitative case study and quantitative simulation approach develops transition pathways including both behavioural and technological change.
   The results show that both technological substitution to low carbon cars or a reconfiguration pathway away from car ownership to mobility lifestyles based on new public transport or cycling and walking for local trips are possible. However, while there is empirical evidence for the initial stage of a technological substitution to battery electric vehicles, transitions away from car ownership as the dominant mobility lifestyle have to overcome an established regime and will require major changes in culture and behaviour as well as support for new priorities in the institutions of transport planning.

ID COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOR; MODEL; MOVEMENT; PATTERNS; ANIMALS; RANGES
AB The relevant research on swarm behavior has focused on the facts that when individuals agree with other members in the system globally consistent behaviors are generated and that individual decisions are completely dominated by other members. In fact, when individuals generate their own behavior strategies, they tend to consider not only the influences of other members but also autonomically consider their current environment. For example, in the social foraging of flocks, the behavior strategy of each individual animal is influenced by the food distribution, and individual movement patterns are characterized by a highly efficient search strategy Levy walks. To investigate this, this paper proposes using an environment-driven social force perspective to explore the Levy walks of individuals in a group in patchy food environments. This model adopts the concept of social force to quantify the social effects and the interactions between individuals and food. The coordination between forces is a key in the formation of individual behavior strategies. Our simulation results show a power-law frequency distribution for agent flight lengths that conforms to Levy walks and verifies the hypothesis of a relationship between food density and the Levy index. In our model, the flock still exhibits collective consistency and cohesion and yields a high value for the order parameter and population density when moving between food patches. In addition, our model explains the intraspecific cooperation and competition that occurs during foraging as proposed in related work. The simulation also validates the impact of two inducements for individual behaviors compared with several benchmark models. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The DeGroot model is a classic model to study consensus of opinion in a group of individuals (agents). Consensus can be achieved under some circumstances. But when the group reach consensus with a convergent opinion value which is not what we expect, how can we intervene the system and change the convergent value? In this paper a mechanism named soft control is first introduced in opinion dynamics to guide the group's opinion when the population are given and evolution rules are not allowed to change. According to the idea of soft control, one or several special agents, called shills, are added and connected to one or several normal agents in the original group. Shills act and are treated as normal agents. The authors prove that the change of convergent opinion value is decided by the initial opinion and influential value of the shill, as well as how the shill connects to normal agents. An interesting and counterintuitive phenomenon is discovered: Adding a shill with an initial opinion value which is smaller (or larger) than the original convergent opinion value dose not necessarily decrease (or increase) the convergent opinion value under some conditions. These conditions are given through mathematical analysis and they are verified by the numerical tests. The authors also find out that the convergence speed of the system varies when a shill is connected to different normal agents. Our simulations show that it is positively related to the degree of the connected normal agent in scale-free networks.

ID REFRACTION CONTRAST
AB Contrast agents have been used in a wide variety of neutron radiographic and radioscopic examinations. Useful contrast agents range from simple hydrogenous materials such as water and oil to exotic compounds such as gadolinium chelates. The properties of the contrast agents also vary widely. Considerations such as the ability to penetrate into cracks, the ability to be removed, the neutron cross-section, or the neutron attenuation mechanism, often steer the investigator to select a particular contrast agent. We have quantified the behavior of the following substances as contrast agents: an aqueous liquid penetrant, a solvent-based liquid penetrant, water, a GdCl3 aqueous solution, and a solution of gadolinium beta-diketonate (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedione) (TMHD) dissolved in acetone and methylene chloride. The experimental tests were carried out using wedge-shaped gaps that simulated cracks, and in actual cracks in Inconel tubing. The experimental results showed that an aqueous solution of GdCl3 used with a wetting agent provided the best performance, but was difficult to remove completely from the crack.

Each vehicle is modeled as a rigid body whose dynamics evolve on Euclidean groups and by which, both position and attitude of the vehicle are considered. The formation control problem of multiple vehicles is decomposed into decentralised control problems of pairs of a vehicle and its parent vehicle. A distributed control law is proposed for vehicles to track a predefined trajectory with desired formations. A numerical simulation is finally included to verify the theoretical results.

AB We consider the average probability X of being informed on a gossip in a given social network. The network is modeled within the random graph theory of Erdos and Renyi. In this theory, a network is characterized by two parameters: the size N and the link probability p. Our experimental data suggest three levels of social inclusion of friendship. The critical value p(c), for which half of agents are informed, scales with the system size as N-gamma with gamma approximate to 0.68. Computer simulations show that the probability X varies with p as a sigmoidal curve. Influence of the correlations between neighbors is also evaluated: with increasing clustering coefficient C, X decreases.

ID TERMINATION
AB Free-radical polymerization of styrene was carried out in the presence of chain transfer agents (CTAs) with functionality, f = 1-4. The size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with an ultraviolet absorption detector (UV) was used to measure the molecular weight distribution (MWD). A Monte Carlo simulation method proposed earlier was used to investigate the experimental results. In this simulation method, one can observe the structure of each polymer molecule directly, and very detailed information can be obtained in a straightforward manner, including the elution curve of SEC. It was found that up to the functionality f = 3, the equal reactivity model that assumes the reactivity of all functional groups in a CTA is equal agrees reasonably well with the experimental results. However, with f = 4, the reactivity of the fourth functional group seems to decrease and the substitution effects may need to be accounted for to fine control the formed branched structure.

AB 1. The biocomplexity approach refers to a fully integrated social-ecological systems (SES) simulation that represents bidirectional feedbacks between social and ecological components. This method is essential to accurately assess impacts of economy and policy on SES such as agroecosystems, where feedbacks between the drivers and impacts of cropping changes need to be simulated. Here we exemplify the biocomplexity approach using energy maize, which is becoming an important source of bioenergy in Europe, and thus, might cause a significant change in land use with knock on-effects for wildlife.
   2. The integrated simulation tool consisted of a farmer decision-making agent-based model fully coupled to the Animal Landscape and Man Simulatin System (ALMaSS), an agent-based simulation system for predicting impacts of land use on a range of Danish wildlife species: the brown hare (Lepus europaeus), the grey partridge (Perdix perdix), the skylark (Alauda arvensis), a carabid beetle (Bembidion lampros), a linyphiid spider (Erigone atra) and the field vole (Microtus agrestis). This was used to assess the impacts of increasing demand on energy maize on the six animal species. Two types of experimental scenarios were evaluated, with and without feedback between the social and ecological system. The assessment of species responses was based on changes in population size, abundance and occupancy.
   3. The response to the cultivation of energy maize was negative for three vertebrate species (skylark, hare and field vole) and positive for partridge and the two invertebrate species. The feedback scenarios showed that the incorporation of information from ecological system to the farmer decision-making affected both a trend in area cultivated with energy maize as well as the animal responses.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Fully coupling agent-based decision-making and environmental simulation allows a detailed representation and integration of both social and ecological components of agricultural systems at proper spatial and temporal scales as well as of dynamic feedbacks between the two systems. By employing easy to interpret measures of changes in abundance and spatial occupancy of animal species, the simulation results could inform and simplify decision-making on expected impacts of economy and policy regulations on wildlife.

AB With the development of high salinity reservoirs, amphiphilic polymers with salt thickening behavior have gained increasing attention. In this work, a betaine-type binary amphiphilic polymer PAMA n with different hydrophobic group contents was synthesized and characterized. The influencing mechanism of different hydrophobic group contents on properties of PAMA was studied by means of viscometer, rheometer, surface tension meter, simultaneous thermal analyzer and fluorescence spectrophotometer. The experimental results showed that the betaine group and hydrophobic group were located in the same association monomer of the PAMA. PAMA was a betaine-type amphiphilic polymer with strong association, high solubility and certain surface activity. Higher hydrophobic group content could enhance the ability to reduce surface tension and the association function between hydrophobic groups of PAMA. The viscosity, thermal stability and viscoelasticity could be improved with the increase of hydrophobic group content. Meanwhile, the PAMA with higher hydrophobic group content showed a better salt thickening behavior. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: Adalimumab, a new-generation anti-inflammatory agent, exerts its effect through tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), secreted from immune response cells such as macrophages and lymphocytes. TNF-alpha has been shown to play an important role in the processes of apoptosis and demyelination, and blockage of its activity may improve neural healing. Investigated in the present study is the probable neuroprotective influence of adalimumab in rats using a peripheral nerve injury model with biochemical and electron microscopic methods.
   METHODS: Forty adult Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into control, sciatic nerve trauma, low-dose adalimumab, and high-dose adalimumab groups. Six rats from each group were assigned biochemical microscopy, and 4 were assigned electron microscopy. Neural injury was induced with clip compression following dissection of sciatic nerves. Adalimumab was simultaneously injected. The rats were sacrificed after 2 weeks of adalimumab treatment.
   RESULTS: Nerve tissue lipid peroxidation values were found to be significantly decreased in both the low-and high-dose adalimumab treatment groups, compared to the group subjected only to sciatic nerve trauma.
   CONCLUSION: Results demonstrate that adalimumab is an effective neuroprotective agent for neural healing, particularly in the early phase.

   Cup-burner modeling; Perfectly stirred reactor; Flame suppression

AB The minimum extinguishing concentration (MEC) of a fire suppression agent is usually determined by the standard cup-burner tests. Recently, a simple model based on extinction of Perfectly Stirred Reactors (PSR) was developed and validated in the prediction of the MECs for inert fire suppressants. The results show good agreement between the model predictions and the experimental data. Furthermore, the results confirmed that the MECs of inert agents are directly correlated to agent integrated heat capacities. In this paper, the model is extended to halogenated agents by adding detailed chemical kinetics of the halogenated agents to a detailed chemical mechanism of n-heptane. The consideration of reactive halogenated species as fire suppression agents increases the complexity in computing the stoichiometry, yet the use of the PSR approach simplifies interpretations relative to 1-d and 2-d simulations. Using this approach, the MEC of halogenated agents are computed and compared against experimental data. Two methods of computation were employed. In the first, "inert PSR" case, only the heptane reaction chemistry was included; so the agent acts solely as an inert and the solution provides a reference point for expected behavior if the agent acted as an inert. In the second, or "reactive PSR" case, agent-related chemistry was included. Good agreement is achieved for Halon 1301 (CF3Br) and R-32 (CH2F2). The computed "inert PSR" values agreed very well with the experimental MEC data for most fluorinated agents, suggesting that chemical inhibition by these fluorinated agents is counter-balanced by the exothermic HF formation and some competing chemical reactions; thus the "net" inhibition is small. In contrast, the "reactive PSR" results show good agreement with brominated agents and are consistent with the known strong catalytic effect of such compounds. The causes for differences between experiment and predicted values are explored and discussed while strengths and limitations are considered. (C) 2010 The Combustion Institute.

AB High-frequency (>10 MHz) ultrasound is used in, e. g., small animal imaging or intravascular applications. Currently available ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) have a suboptimal response for high frequencies. This study therefore investigates the nonlinear propagation effects in a high-frequency ultrasound field (25 MHz) and its use for standard UCA and diagnostic frequencies (1-3 MHz). Nonlinear mixing of two high-frequency carrier waves produces a low-frequency wave, known as the self-demodulation or parametric array effect. Hydrophone experiments showed that the self-demodulated field of a focused 25 MHz transducer (850 kPa source pressure) has an amplitude of 45 kPa at 1.5 MHz in water. Such pressure level is sufficient for UCA excitation. Experimental values are confirmed by numerical simulations using the Khokhlov-Zabolotskaya-Kuznetsov equation on a spatially convergent grid.

AB In line with previous research, the evolution of social conventions is explored by n-way coordination games. A convention is said to be established if the decisions of all actors become synchronised over time. In contrast to the earlier studies, an empirically well-grounded process of reinforcement learning is used as behavioural assumption. The model is called melioration learning. It is shown by agent-based simulations that melioration enables the actors to establish a convention. Besides the payoffs of the coordination game, the network structure of interactions affects the actors' ability to coordinate their choices and the speed of convergence. The results of melioration learning are compared to predictions of the Roth-Erev model.

AB This study explores the profit impact of seeding programs-giving away free new products to enhance new product diffusion. We conducted extensive agent-based simulation experiments using empirical social connectivity data from five consumer social networks. The findings suggest that the effect of consumer homophily-the similarity of adjacent consumers in a social network-on the profit impact of seeding depends on the seeding target. Consumer homophily negatively affects the profit Impact of seeding early adopters but it exhibits a U-shaped relationship with the profit impact of seeding social hubs and random seeding. The right side of the U-shaped curve (high homophily) reflects a higher profit impact when compared to the left side (low homophily). We integrate literature from sociology, social networks, and marketing to explain this finding. The results also suggest that seeding social hubs generates the greatest NPV (net present value), followed by seeding randomly chosen targets, and early adopters, in that order. Finally, we explore the optimal seeding size-the percentage of the market to seed-and discuss managerial implications for seeding strategies. (C) 2014 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB An experimental and theoretical analysis of the polypropylene foaming process using three different chemical blowing agents (CBA) was performed. A simple experiment was designed to analyze the foaming process of polypropylene (PP)/CO2 system under two different pressure conditions. The expansion ratio and final foam structure was measured both by direct observation and from optical measurements and image analysis, showing a good agreement. A single bubble simulation based on relevant differential scanning calorimetry and thermo-gravimetrical analysis experiments, assuming each CBA particles as a nucleation site and accounting for gas diffusion in the surrounding polymer matrix has been built. The sensitivity of the model to physical and processing parameters has been tested. The calculation results are compared to the experiments and open the route to a simplified method for evaluating the efficiency of CBA. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 55:2018-2029, 2015.

AB Integrating humans in our perception of ecosystems is of critical importance to adequately protect natural resources. This poses the challenge of understanding human decision making in the context of decisions potentially threatening nature's integrity. We developed a spatially explicit agent-based model that simulates commercial whale-watching vessel movements based on a representation of the captains' decision making process when observing marine mammals in and around the Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park in Quebec, Canada. We focus here on the human part of the global model, the submodel of whale movements having been developed and validated independently (Lamontagne, 2009). The objective of this study is to select and validate a model of whale-watching captains' decision making using the pattern-oriented modelling approach (POM): three models of cognitive heuristics (satisficing, tallying and Take The Best) along with a null model (random choice) were tested. These concurrent decision making models were built upon knowledge extracted from data collected during field investigations, including interviews with whale-watching captains and park wardens, onboard and shore-based observations, and analyses of a multi-year dataset of sampled whale-watching excursions. Model selection is performed by statistically comparing simulated and real patterns of boat trajectories (excursion length), spatial hotspots (kernel home range 50%), and excursion content (species observed, time allocated to different activities). The selection process revealed that the Take The Best heuristic was the best performing model. We used the distribution of the number of whale-watching boats in the vicinity (2000 m) of each vessel as a secondary pattern to validate the ability of each decision making model to reproduce real observations. Given the prevalence of the species attribute in the choice of which whale to observe, the Take The Best heuristic's ability to deal with non-compensatory information partly explains its overall best performance. Moreover, implementation of communication abilities between modelled captains led to the emergence of persistent observation sites in the park, which is a well-known collective spatiotemporal characteristic of the whale-watching industry; thus validating the fundamental assumption that cooperation is an important mechanism behind the pattern of whale-watching boat dynamics. The relatively good performance of the satisficing and tallying heuristics supports both field evidence and literature on bounded rationality in that humans likely use collections of heuristics (adaptive toolbox) to solve decision problems in different contexts. The POM strategy appears suitable to build up an informative ABM regarding the management of human activities in a natural environment so that further developments will be assessed following the same approach.

DE Feedback strategy; multiagent reach-avoid games; quickest descent
   control; state-space partition
AB We address a planar multiagent pursuit-evasion game with a terminal constraint (reach-avoid game). Specifically, we consider the problem of steering a single evader to a target location, while avoiding capture by multiple pursuers. We propose a feasible control strategy for the evader, against a group of pursuers that adopts a semi-cooperative strategy. First, we characterize a partition of the game's state-space, that allows us to determine the existence of a solution to the game based on the initial conditions of the players. Next, based on the time-derivative of an appropriately defined risk metric, we develop a nonlinear state feedback strategy for the evader which provides a feasible solution to the game. This control strategy involves switching between different control laws in different parts of the state-space. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed feedback control in terms of the evader's performance, through numerical simulations. We also show that for the special case of the reach-avoid game with only one pursuer, the proposed control law is successful in guiding the evader to the target location from almost all initial conditions, and ensures that the evader will remain uncaptured.

AB Increasing computing capability and high-resolution digital tracing of human behavior make large-scale computational models for individual-based realistic simulation available. Reconstructing a virtual computational environment is crucial for designing and implementing individual interactions in an artificial society as human beings behave in the real world. In this paper, we propose a methodology to recreate a virtual city by utilizing statistical data and geographic information. The synthetic population and physical environment are baseline components of the virtual city. Individual-based modeling is used to specify individuals' demographic characteristics, and each individual is endowed with heterogeneous social attributes. Various physical environments are generated with geographic locations and mapped with individuals to support daily mobility, migration, and interaction. A series of algorithms are proposed to bridge the gap between macroscopic data and microscopic models, and guarantee equivalence between them. Based on the methodology, we reconstructed a virtual city of Beijing, and presented the statistical analysis of population structure, spatial distribution of physical environments, human travel characteristics, and spatial topologies of social networks. Our synthetic population can represent individual actors in the form of households and household members, and the synthetic population is statistically equivalent to a real population. The proposed methodology is efficient to recreate a synthetic virtual city and can serve as a base for computational experiments.

AB Previous clinical studies on the train-of-four (TOF) fade have used different recording techniques, anesthesia agents and muscles for measurement, thus comparison of the results has become difficult.  On 49 surgical patients divided into 6 groups, we compared:  1) the TOF fade ratios (T4/T1) produced by d-tubocurarine (dTc), pancuronium (P), atracurium (A), and vecuronium (V) and 2) the influence of previously given suxamethonium on TOF ratios (dTc and P).  Neuromuscular block (NMB) was monitored simultaneously by electromyography (EMG) and by mechanomyography (MMG).  Differences between the TOF fade ratios of different groups were determined and statistically analyzed by ANOVA of repeated measures, 1) at onset, as compared to spontaneous recovery with the same agent, 2) between NMB agents at (a) onset and (b) during recovery.  Results:  TOF fade was significantly more pronounced during spontaneous recovery than during onset of NMB:  a) with all NMB agents, b) with both EMG and MMG responses, with bolus dose administration of the agents, c) the degrees of TOF fade significantly differed between NMB agents during onset, d) the degrees of TOF fade (MMG) were more pronounced during onset when the agents were given in incremental doses following succinylcholine as compared to degrees of fade following single bolus doses in the absence of succinylcholine.  During recovery, there was also difference in the TOF fade ratios among the agents:  dTc and P produced more fade than A and V.  There were variable differences during recovery between the groups which received succinylcholine and incremental doses of dTc and P vs those which received these agents in single bolus doses.  Since there were two variables (e.g. mode of administration and succinylcholine) between these groups, no reasonable explanation can be offered to explain these differences during the recovery phase.

AB Autonomic self-healing cernentitious materials generally rely upon the transport of adhesives via capillary flow in discrete cracks to heal macro-cracks. A series of experimental and numerical studies are presented that simulate the capillary flow of cyanoacrylate in a range of discrete cracks in prismatic cementitious specimens. The numerical procedure developed incorporates corrections to established capillary flow theory to consider stick-slip behaviour of the meniscus and frictional dissipation at the meniscus wall boundary. In addition, two short benchmark studies are reported in order to firstly verify the time-viscosity relationship of the cyanoacrylate in a mortar capillary channel and secondly to examine the capillary flow of the healing agent in small diameter glass capillaries. These studies also provide data to validate the numerical model. The capillary rise response of a healing agent in a self-healing system is predicted using the calibrated model and verified with published experimental data. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB Nonlinear response of microbubbles illuminated with ultrasound pulse was investigated through experiments and numerical calculations to build the basis for ultrasound blood flow image enhancement system (harmonic imaging system) using higher harmonic components based on nonlinear behavior of microbubbles for ultrasound contrast agents. The effects of membrane coating, size distribution and randomness of spatial distribution of microbubbles were examined. The relationship between the number of cycles in illuminated pulse and the higher harmonic component excitation efficiency, in particular, was studied and a tendency was found for the number of cycles larger than six cycles to cause gradual increase in the second harmonic component excitation efficiency. The simulated and experimental results were in good agreement. Furthermore, the simulated results using the conventional mathematical model ignoring the compressibility of liquid around bubbles showed a tendency of variation opposite to that of experimental results in the relationship between the illuminated ultrasound frequency and the second harmonic component excitation efficiency. On the contrary, the simulated results taking account of compressibility showed a good agreement with the experimental results. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Call centers; cross-training; discrete-event systems simulation;
   simulation optimization; service operations; service systems
AB Call centers have grown world-wide during the past decade. One of the most important aspects considered by call center managers is the optimization of its operators, which implies covering the highly variable demand and finding an efficient way to assign people to certain shifts in order to achieve a desirable service level and abandonment rate. Another challenge is determining which system setup is appropriate for the specific call center. Should we have a single-skill call center or multi-skill call center? If we do have the latter, how many multi-skill agents should we have on staff? In this case study, we generate and analyze discrete-event systems simulation-optimization models to test the behavior of a real-world call center under the actual configuration and under different levels of cross-training. The model results help call center managers by: 1) determining the optimal number of operators needed for different staff configurations in order to achieve the targets for service level and abandonment; 2) providing information about the trade-off between the key measurements in the call center; and 3) providing useful information about the number of operators needed and used for each hour of operation to estimate the number of four-hour shifts required to achieve the performance targets. Our experimental findings from this case study suggest that a bi-skill call center is economically better in the long-run compared to a full-skill or single-skill call center. This case study augments the call center body of knowledge by providing additional managerial insights for the operations management community.

AB In this work we consider the presence of contrarian agents in discrete 3-state kinetic exchange opinion models. The contrarians are individuals that adopt the choice opposite to the prevailing choice of their contacts, whatever this choice is. We consider binary as well as three-agent interactions, with stochastic parameters, in a fully-connected population. Our numerical results suggest that the presence of contrarians destroys the absorbing state of the original model, changing the transition to the para-ferromagnetic type. In this case, the consequence for the society is that the three opinions coexist in the population, in both phases (ordered and disordered). Furthermore, the order disorder transition is suppressed for a sufficient large fraction of contrarians. In some cases the transition is discontinuous, and it changes to continuous before it is suppressed. Some of our results are complemented by analytical calculations based on the master equation.

AB Chemical warfare agents (CWAs) are regarded as a critical challenge in our society. Here, we use a high-throughput computational screening strategy backed up by experimental validation to identify and synthesize a promising porous material for CWA removal under humid conditions. Starting with a database of 2,932 existing metal organic framework (MOF) structures, we selected those possessing cavities big enough to adsorb well-known CWAs such as sarin, soman, and mustard gas as well as their nontoxic simulants. We used Widom method to reduce significantly the simulation time of water adsorption, allowing us to shortlist 156 hydrophobic MOFs where water will not compete with the CWAs to get adsorbed. We then moved to grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations to assess the removal capacity of CWAs. We selected the best candidates in terms of performance but also in terms of chemical stability and moved to synthesis and experimental breakthrough adsorption to probe the predicted, excellent performance. This computational-experimental work represents a fast and efficient approach to screen porous materials in applications that involve the presence of moisture.

AB Observing that most social networks are clustered, the literature often argues that agents are more willing to form links that close triangles. We challenge this idea by proposing a simple model of new collaboration formation that shows why network clustering may arise even though agents do not "like" network closure. We address empirically this question on the longitudinal evolution of the French co-invention network, and find that two inventors are less likely to form a first research collaboration when they have common partners. Our findings further reveal the preferences of inventors towards forming non-redundant connections. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB A novel method combined theoretical and experimental study for environmental friendly silver electroplating was introduced. Quantum chemical calculations and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were employed for predicting the behaviour and function of the complexing agents. Electronic properties, orbital information, and single point energies of the 5,5-dimethylhydantoin (DMH), nicotinic acid (NA), as well as their silver(I)-complexes were provided by quantum chemical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). Adsorption behaviors of the agents on copper and silver surfaces were investigated using MD simulations. Basing on the data of quantum chemical calculations and MD simulations, we believed that DMH and NA could be the promising complexing agents for silver electroplating. The experimental results, including of electrochemical measurement and silver electroplating, further confirmed the above prediction. This efficient and versatile method thus opens a new window to study or design complexing agents for generalized metal electroplating and will vigorously promote the level of this research region.

ID EVOLUTION
AB In a previous paper [11 we presented simulation results that demonstrated the evolution of "tag based" groups composed of cooperative (in-group altruistic) individual agents performing specialised functions. We showed how "teams" of individual maximisers (who copy the behaviours of those who outperform them) come to form internally specialised and cooperative groups that efficiently exploit their environment. We have also demonstrated [1, 2, 3] that the efficiency of the specialisation process is highly dependent on the "searching strategy" employed by agents to locate in-group members with required skills. Specifically we showed that populations of agents with "smart" searching strategies outperformed populations of "dumb" (random) search strategies - even when the costs of smart searching were much higher. We hypothesised that in mixed populations smart strategies would out-evolve dumb ones. In this paper we test this hypothesis. Our results show that smart strategies do indeed outperform dumb strategies for significant periods of time but that dumb strategies persist also. The time series of individual runs show cycles of smart and dumb strategies in the population over generations. We argue that the study of such phenomena offers a possible minimal way towards understanding the evolution of institutional roles and internal specialisation - without positing actions that originate at the supra-individual level (though we do not discount such actions).

AB We consider a network of interacting agents and we model the process of choice on the adoption of a given innovative product by means of statistical-mechanics tools. The modelization allows us to focus on the effects of direct interactions among agents in establishing the success or failure of the product itself. Mimicking real systems, the whole population is divided into two sub-communities called, respectively, Innovators and Followers, where the former are assumed to display more influence power. We study in detail and via numerical simulations on a random graph two different scenarios: no-feedback interaction, where innovators are cohesive and not sensitively affected by the remaining population, and feedback interaction, where the influence of followers on innovators is non negligible. The outcomes are markedly different: in the former case, which corresponds to the creation of a niche in the market, Innovators are able to drive and polarize the whole market. In the latter case the behavior of the market cannot be definitely predicted and become unstable. In both cases we highlight the emergence of collective phenomena and we show how the final outcome, in terms of the number of buyers, is affected by the concentration of innovators and by the interaction strengths among agents.

ID STATISTICAL-MECHANICS
AB In this paper, we continue our analysis of spatial versions of agent-based models for the dynamics of money that have been introduced in the statistical physics literature, focusing on two models with debts. Both models consist of systems of economical agents located on a finite connected graph representing a social network. Each agent is characterized by the number of coins she has, which can be negative in case she is in debt, and each monetary transaction consists in one coin moving from one agent to one of her neighbors. In the first model, that we name the model with individual debt limit, the agents are allowed to individually borrow up to a fixed number of coins. In the second model, that we name the model with collective debt limit, agents can borrow coins from a central bank as long as the bank is not empty, with reimbursements occurring each time an agent in debt receives a coin. Based on numerical simulations of the models on complete graphs, it was conjectured that, in the large population/temperature limits, the distribution of money converges to a shifted exponential distribution for the model with individual debt limit, and to an asymmetric Laplace distribution for the model with collective debt limit. In this paper, we prove exact formulas for the distribution of money that are valid for all possible social networks. Taking the large population/temperature limits in the formula found for the model with individual debt limit, we prove convergence to the shifted exponential distribution, thus establishing the first conjecture. Simplifying the formula found for the model with collective debt limit is more complicated, but using a computer to plot this formula shows an almost perfect fit with the Laplace distribution, which strongly supports the second conjecture.

ID SZNAJD MODEL; DYNAMICS
AB In this work, we study a continuous opinion dynamics model considering 3-agent interactions and group pressure. Agents interact in a fully-connected population, and two parameters govern the dynamics: the agents' convictions A that are homogeneous in the population, and the group pressure p. Stochastic parameters also drive the interactions. Our analytical and numerical results indicate that the model undergoes symmetry-breaking transitions at distinct critical points A for any value of p < p* = 2/3, i.e. the transition can be suppressed for sufficiently high group pressure. Such transition separates two phases: for any A < Ac, the order parameter 0 is identically null (0 = 0, a symmetric, absorbing phase), while for A > Ac, we have 0 > 0, i.e. a symmetry-broken phase (ferromagnetic). The numerical simulations also reveal that the increase of group pressure leads to a wider distribution of opinions, decreasing the extremism in the population.

AB In this work we study the collective behavior in a model of a simplified homogeneous society. Each agent is modeled as a binary "perceptron", receiving neighbors' opinions as inputs and outputting one of two possible opinions, according to the conformist attitude and to the external pressure of mass media. For a neighborhood size greater than three, the system shows a very complex phase diagram, including a disordered phase and chaotic behavior. We present analytic calculations, mean fields approximation and numerical simulations for different values of the parameters.

AB Almost 200 pharmaceutical chemicals and groups of drugs have been evaluated for their carcinogenic properties by working groups convened by the International Agency for the Research on Cancer. Therapeutic agents are exceptional environmental carcinogens in that humans are exposed to relatively pure substances at well-defined dosages. Of those evaluated, 20 are conclusively carcinogenic to humans and 52 are probably or possibly carcinogenic. The human tissues most often affected are bone marrow, skin, urinary bladder, liver, lymphatic tissue and endometrium. In cases in which there is sufficient evidence for carcinogenicity from both epidemiological and experimental studies, the similarity between humans and animals with regard to the target organs involved is close (85%). Since data on carcinogenicity exist for several groups of pharmaceuticals, risk versus benefit evaluations should be made carefully in relation to possible clinical applications.

AB Synthetic samples of Ag(I) and Cu(II) cations were treated with acidified dealginated Sargassum filipendula, a modified waste from the thickener industry. Binary isotherms demonstrated a balance of simultaneous chemisorption and physisorption processes, pointing out to the presence of ion-exchange, chelation, and complexation mechanisms along with a preference for 2-plus-charged copper ions. Modified-extended Langmuir, noncompetitive Langmuir, and Langmuir-Freundlich models exhibited good fit to the experimental data, indicating the complex interactions among adsorbates, active sites, and other soft metals involved. The initial composition of the samples and the operation temperature demonstrated to influence the selectivity of the process. Maximum biosorption capacities were achieved at 30 degrees C for copper (3.60 mmol g(-1)) and silver (8.67 mmol g(-1)). Na(2)EDTA under acidic conditions was able to retrieve previously biosorbed copper ions selectively and at high rates even at very low concentrations of the chelating agent. HNO3 demonstrated high efficiency in removing silver from the biosorbent surface. It is suggested to recover selectively the metals, not only treating wastewater but also separating them for further purposes. XPS analysis marked the main role played by oxygenated groups in binding the adsorbates and the presence of Ag(I) and Cu(I) after the process could be detected. Copper reduction indicated chemical interactions and polarization effects due to the alginate net and elemental silver presence could not be discarded.

TI Synchrotron MicroCT Reveals the Potential of the Dual Contrast Technique

AB Dual contrast micro computed tomography (CT) shows potential for detecting articular cartilage degeneration. However, the performance of conventional CT systems is limited by beam hardening, low image resolution (full-body CT), and long acquisition times (conventional microCT). Therefore, to reveal the full potential of the dual contrast technique for imaging cartilage composition we employ the technique using synchrotron microCT. We hypothesize that the above-mentioned limitations are overcome with synchrotron microCT utilizing monochromatic X-ray beam and fast image acquisition. Human osteochondral samples (n = 41, four cadavers) were immersed in a contrast agent solution containing two agents (cationic CA4+ and non-ionic gadoteridol) and imaged with synchrotron microCT at an early diffusion time point (2 h) and at diffusion equilibrium (72 h) using two monochromatic X-ray energies (32 and 34 keV). The dual contrast technique enabled simultaneous determination of CA4+ (i.e., proteoglycan content) and gadoteridol (i.e., water content) partitions within cartilage. Cartilage proteoglycan content and biomechanical properties correlated significantly (0.327 < r < 0.736, p < 0.05) with CA4+ partition in superficial and middle zones at both diffusion time points. Normalization of the CA4+ partition with gadoteridol partition within the cartilage significantly (p < 0.05) improved the detection sensitivity for human osteoarthritic cartilage proteoglycan content, biomechanical properties, and overall condition (Mankin, Osteoarthritis Research Society International, and International Cartilage Repair Society grading systems). The dual energy technique combined with the dual contrast agent enables assessment of human articular cartilage proteoglycan content and biomechanical properties based on CA4+ partition determined using synchrotron microCT. Additionally, the dual contrast technique is not limited by the beam hardening artifact of conventional CT systems. (c) 2019 The Authors.

   MINORITY; BEHAVIOR
AB In this work we study opinion formation in a population participating in a public debate with two distinct choices. We consider three distinct mechanisms of social interactions and individuals' behavior: conformity, nonconformity, and inflexibility. The conformity is ruled by the majority-rule dynamics, whereas the nonconformity is introduced in the population as an independent behavior, implying the failure of attempted group influence. Finally, the inflexible agents are introduced in the population with a given density. These individuals present a singular behavior, in a way that their stubbornness makes them reluctant to change their opinions. We consider these effects separately and all together, with the aim to analyze the critical behavior of the system. We perform numerical simulations in some lattice structures and for distinct population sizes. Our results suggest that the different formulations of the model undergo order-disorder phase transitions in the same universality class as the Ising model. Some of our results are complemented by analytical calculations.

ID PROTECTION; NETWORKS; DESIGN; STATE
AB Due to the deployment of renewable energy supplies in a smart grid (SG), various distributed power devices need to form groups dynamically to meet their requirements on power supply and demand. A communication agent or controller is coupled with each power device to exchange control state or management information with others. The underneath communication networks that enable the connections among the devices become to consist of many ad hoc groups with dynamic size and topology. Consequently, with dynamic requirement on power supply and demand, the grouping becomes a particularly challenging problem to synchronize the power devices, because the communication delays with dynamic group settings may vary frequently and significantly. In this paper, first, we propose queueing models to estimate the communication delays of the nodes in the SG. The cost of the added security to the communications is also analyzed in various scenarios. Second, we propose a smart timing adjustment algorithm with a new timing adaptive grouping (TAG) protocol, so that each agent can dynamically adjust its operational timing configuration and determine its grouping condition. Third, we develop a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed, which can be used to validate many SG applications. Finally, our experimental and simulation results on the HIL testbed have demonstrated that the proposed TAG protocol can be used to ensure the successful grouping dynamically.

ID ERRORS
AB The objective of this work was to study the dynamics of human emotional states in the process of social interaction in a virtual environment. The previously developed for this purpose prototypes of the virtual actor (NPC) and its virtual environment simulator "Teleport" underwent significant re-design and modification. The experimental platform was re-implemented and used in experiments with college student participants, combining electromyography, emotion recognition in facial recordings and model-based game log analysis in a social videogame paradigm. Participants interacted with two virtual actors implemented based on the eBICA cognitive architecture (Samsonovich, 2013, 2018). Positive correlations were found between eBICA model predictions and participant affects extracted from their facial expressions and facial muscle activity. Affective dynamics of social phenomena, such as the establishment of partnership or an act of betrayal, were characterized and found consistent with the model predictions. Other findings include a gradually developing emotional reaction, possibly due to the integration of appraisals of game events. Overall, obtained results confirm the eBICA model, suggesting its further extension and refinement. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We present a detailed study of the decomposition of Sarin on the Zr-based UiO-66 and MOF-808 metal organic frameworks (MOFs) using electronic structure calculations. The central step of the mechanism involves nucleophilic addition of OH to the nerve agent coordinated to a Zr atom of the MOF. This addition process generates a phosphorus pentacoordinated intermediate from which phosphonic acid products are formed through an elimination step, which also produces HF or isopropanol. Two major mechanisms have been probed. In the lowest-energy mechanism, a hydroxide ligand coordinated to a MOF Zr atom acts as the nucleophile in the addition step. In the second mechanism, which exhibits a slightly larger barrier, this Zr-OH group acts as a base to deprotonate a water molecule and generate a hydroxide moiety that concertedly adds to the nerve agent. In both mechanisms, the phosphonic acid products of the nerve-agent decomposition are strongly bound to the MOFs, suggesting that regeneration of the catalyst at the gas-surface interface might necessitate thermal treatment. The atomistic details of the reaction mechanism revealed by this work augment a growing body of experimental efforts that have recently demonstrated efficient catalytic decomposition of nerve agents by Zr-based MOFs in solution, but have not yet probed the reaction at the gas surface interface.

AB Modeling individual and crowd behaviors is the basis for evacuation research, which is essential to reduce casualties under emergency conditions in large venues. This paper focuses on the pedestrian evacuation of large-scale venues with multiple exits, and proposes an improved pedestrian evacuation model which uses a novel dual-strategy adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm with affinity propagation clustering. Compared with the traditional models, the proposed model is demonstrated to have a better performance in simulating pedestrians' herding behavior in panic situations, especially when not familiar with the environment, as i) individual heterogeneity is considered and affinity propagation clustering is used in population division to simulate the process of people spontaneously gathering into swarms; ii) A dual-strategy updating scheme is designed to balance the cognition difference between the leaders and the agents in the swarm; and iii) Adaptive control of parameters is used to simulate the human-surrounding interaction and psychological fluctuates when the evacuees are moving towards exits. Numerical examples, which simulated the evacuation of a rectangle venue with multiple exits, demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed model. Moreover, the influences of pedestrian velocity, characteristics of exits, and leader movement on evacuation are analyzed. Experimental results show that the movement of leaders is different from other evacuees and the parameters of doors, such as width, quantity, and location all have a great influence on evacuation time.

AB Simulation with agent-based models is increasingly used in the study of complex socio-technical systems and in social simulation in general. This paradigm offers a number of attractive features, namely the possibility of modeling emergent phenomena within large populations. As a consequence, often the quantity in need of calibration may be a distribution over the population whose relation with the parameters of the model is analytically intractable. Nevertheless, we can simulate. In this paper we present a simulation-based framework for the calibration of agent-based models with distributional output based on indirect inference. We illustrate our method step by step on a model of norm emergence in an online community of peer production, using data from three large Wikipedia communities. Model fit and diagnostics are discussed.

We analyse residents' statements and police hearings gathered after Victoria Black Saturday bushfires in 2009 to deduce a model of human behaviour based on the distinction between objective (capabilities, danger) and subjective (confidence, risk aversion) attributes, and on individual motivations. We evaluate it against observed behaviour archetypes and statistics, and show its explicative value.

AB New empirical models of consumer demand that incorporate social effects seek to measure the causal effect of past adopter's behavior the "installed-base" on current adoption behavior. Identifying such causal effects is challenging due to several alternative confounds that generate correlation in agents' actions. In the absence of experimental variation, a preferred solution has been to control for these spurious correlations using a rich specification of fixed effects. The authors show that fixed-effects estimators of this sort are inconsistent in the presence of installed-base effects; in simulations, random-effects specifications perform even worse. The analysis reveals the tension the applied empiricist faces in this area: a rich control for unobservables increases the credibility of the reported causal effects, but the incorporation of these controls introduces biases of a new kind in this class of models. The authors present two solutions: a modified version of an instrumental variable approach and a new bias-correction approach, both of which deliver consistent estimates of causal installed-base effects. The empirical application to the adoption of the Toyota Prius Hybrid in California shows evidence for social influence in diffusion and reveals that implementing the bias correction reverses the sign of the measured installed-base effect. The authors also discuss implications of the results for identification of models in marketing involving state dependence in demand, and incorporating discrete games of strategic interaction.

AB In this paper, we study two PDEs that generalize the urban crime model proposed by Short et al. (2008 Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci. 18, 1249-1267). Our modifications are made under assumption of the spatial heterogeneity of both the near-repeat victimization effect and the dispersal strategy of criminal agents. We investigate pattern formations in the reaction-advection-diffusion systems with non-linear diffusion over multi-dimensional bounded domains subject to homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. It is shown that the positive homogeneous steady state loses its stability as the intrinsic near-repeat victimization rate epsilon decreases and spatially inhomogeneous steady states emerge through bifurcation. Moreover, we find the wavemode selection mechanism through rigorous stability analysis of these non-trivial spatial patterns, which shows that the only stable pattern must have a wavenumber that maximizes the bifurcation value. Based on this wavemode selection mechanism, we will be able to predict the formation of stable aggregates of the house attractiveness and criminal population density, at least when the diffusion rate epsilon is around the principal bifurcation value. Our theoretical results also suggest that large domains support more stable aggregates than small domains. Finally, we perform extensive numerical simulations over 1D intervals and 2D squares to illustrate and verify our theoretical findings. Our numerics also demonstrate the formation of other interesting patterns in these models such as the merging of two interior spikes and the emerging of new spikes, etc. These non-trivial solutions can model the well-observed phenomenon of aggregation in urban criminal activities.

AB Rational criminals choose crime over lawfulness because it pays better; hence poverty correlates to criminal behavior. This correlation is an insufficient historical explanation. An agent-based model of urban crime, mortality, and exogenous population shocks supplements the standard economic story, closing the gap with an empirical reality that often breaks from trend. Agent decision making within the model is built around a career maximization function, with life expectancy as the key independent variable. Rational choice takes the form of a local information heuristic, resulting in subjectively rational suboptimal decision making. The effects of population shocks are explored using the Crime and Mortality Simulation (CAMSIM), with effects demonstrated to persist across generations. Past social trauma are found to lead to higher crime rates which subsequently decline as the effect degrades, though 'aftershocks' are often experienced.

DT Article
DE adoption; phase transition; mean-field; social contagion; spreading
ID INFORMATION; CONTAGION; MODELS
AB Models of social diffusion reflect processes of how new products, ideas, or behaviors are adopted in a population. These models typically lead to a continuous or a discontinuous phase transition of the number of adopters as a function of a control parameter. We explore a simple model of social adoption where the agents can be in two states, either adopters or non-adopters, and can switch between these two states interacting with other agents through a network. The probability of an agent to switch fromnon-adopter to adopter depends on the number of adopters in her network neighborhood, the adoption threshold T and the adoption coefficient a, two parameters defining a Hill function. In contrast, the transition from adopter to non-adopter is spontaneous at a certain rate mu. In a mean-field approach, we derive the governing ordinary differential equations and show that the nature of the transition between the global non-adoption and global adoption regimes depends mostly on the balance between the probability to adopt with one and two adopters. The transition changes from continuous, via a transcritical bifurcation, to discontinuous, via a combination of a saddle-node and a transcritical bifurcation, through a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation. We characterize the full parameter space. Finally, we compare our analytical results with Monte Carlo simulations on annealed and quenched degree regular networks, showing a better agreement for the annealed case. Our results show how a simplemodel is able to capture two seemingly very different types of transitions, i.e., continuous and discontinuous and thus unifies underlying dynamics for different systems. Furthermore, the form of the adoption probability used here is based on empirical measurements.

AB In this paper, a new self interaction mechanism is integrated into two typical pairwise models including the prisoner's dilemma and snowdrift games, where an additional payoff will be awarded into the cooperative agents. In the prisoner's dilemma game, we take three types of additional payoffs into account, to be a fixed constant, a random value situated within the positive unilateral interval and a random one uniformly distributed within a bilateral interval. Large quantities of numerical simulations indicate the promotion of cooperation can be very noticeable whether in the case of von Neumann neighborhood or Moore neighborhood. In the meantime, the self interaction will also be extended into the snowdrift game in which two equilibria exist, and the outcomes clearly show that the collective cooperation is still drastically elevated into a higher level. Current results demonstrate that the self interaction might become a potential and effective means to enhance the behavior of cooperation, and be helpful for us to deeply understand the widespread persistence and emergence of cooperation within many animal and human being societies.

ID PHYSICS
AB In this paper, we introduce a simple Monte Carlo method for simulating the dynamics of a crowd. Within our model a collection of hard-disk agents is subjected to a series of two-stage steps, implying (i) the displacement of one specific agent followed by (ii) a rearrangement of the rest of the group through a Monte Carlo dynamics. The rules for the combined steps are determined by the specific setting of the granular flow, so that our scheme should be easily adapted to describe crowd dynamics issues of many sorts, from stampedes in panic scenarios to organized flow around obstacles or through bottlenecks. We validate our scheme by computing the serving times statistics of a group of agents crowding to be served around a desk. In the case of a size homogeneous crowd, we recover intuitive results prompted by physical sense. However, as a further illustration of our theoretical framework, we show that heterogeneous systems display a less obvious behavior, as smaller agents feature shorter serving times. Finally, we analyze our results in the light of known properties of nonequilibrium hard-disk fluids and discuss general implications of our model.

AB In previous research, the SE-NW time-trend in the age of the earliest Neolithic sites across Europe has been treated as a signal of a global-scale process that brought farming/herding economies to the continent. Residual variation from this global time-trend is generally treated as 'noise'. A Complex Adaptive Systems perspective views this empirical record differently. The apparent time-trend is treated as an emergent consequence of the interactions of individuals and group of different scale.
   Here, we examine the dynamics of agricultural dispersals, using the rich body evidence available from the Iberian Peninsula as a case study. We integrate two complementary approaches: (1) creating a high resolution Agent Based Modeling environment to simulate different processes that may have driven the spread of farming; (2) collecting and synthesizing empirical archeological data for the earliest Neolithic settlements that we use to evaluate our models results.
   Our results suggest that, (a) the source of radiocarbon data used to evaluate alternative hypotheses play an important role in the results; and (b) the model scenario that produces de best fit with archeological data implies a dispersal via northwestern and southern routes; a preference for leap-frog movement; an influence of ecological conditions (selecting most favorable agricultural land) and demographic factors (avoiding settled regions).
   This work represents a first attempt at high-resolution bottom-up modeling of this important dynamic in human prehistory. While we recognize that other social and environmental drivers could have also affected the dispersal of agropastoral systems, those considered here include many that have been widely considered important in prior research and so warrant inclusion.

AB Collective emotional behavior of users is frequently observed on various Web portals; however, its complexity and the role of emotions in the acting mechanisms are still not thoroughly understood. In this work, using the empirical data and agent-based modeling, a parallel analysis is performed of two archetypal systems-Blogs and Internet-Relayed-Chats-both of which maintain self-organized dynamics but not the same communication rules and time scales. The emphasis is on quantifying the collective emotions by means of fractal analysis of the underlying processes as well as topology of social networks, which arise and co-evolve in these stochastic processes. The results reveal that two distinct mechanisms, which are based on different use of emotions (an emotion is characterized by two components, arousal and valence), are intrinsically associated with two classes of emergent social graphs. Their hallmarks are the evolution of communities in accordance with the excess of the negative emotions on popular Blogs, on one side, and smooth spreading of the Bot's emotional impact over the entire hierarchical network of chats, on the other. Another emphasis of this work is on the understanding of nonextensivity of the emotion dynamics; it was found that, in its own way, each mechanism leads to a reduced phase space of the emotion components when the collective dynamics takes place. That a non-additive entropy describes emotion dynamics, is further confirmed by computing the q-generalized Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy rate in the empirical data of chats as well as in the simulations of interacting emotional agents and Bots.

AB We investigated serial changes of the Kupffer cell (KC) function and hepatic oxygen saturation (sO(2)) using contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging (CEUS) and photoacoustic imaging (PAI) in preneoplastic changes during cholangiocarcinogenesis induced by obstructive cholangitis and N-nitrosodimethylamine in a mouse model. The CEUS and PAI were performed to assess Sonazoid contrast agent uptake by KC and changes in the sO(2) of liver parenchyma. An extensive bile ductular reaction, cystic dilatation, and epithelial hyperplasia with dysplastic changes were noted in the experimental group. During the preneoplastic changes, the parenchymal echogenicity on the Kupffer-phase of CEUS was continuously decreased in the experimental group, and which means that the Sonazoid phagocytosis by KC was decreased. The number of KCs was increased in the CD68 analysis, indicating functionally impaired KCs. There was a simultaneous serial decrease in sO(2) on PAI measurement of the experimental group during the preneoplastic changes. The experimental group also showed significantly higher expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor protein. Our study demonstrated that KC dysfunction and hypoxic environmental changes were the factors influencing preneoplastic change during cholangiocarcinogenesis, and we could non-invasively monitor these changes using CEUS and PAI.

AB Trajectory data from observations of a random-walk process are often used to characterize macroscopic transport coefficients and to make inferences about motility mechanisms. Continuum equations describing the average moments of the position of an agent in an exclusion process are derived and validated with simulation data. Unlike standard noninteracting random walks, the moment equations for the exclusion process explicitly represent the interaction of agents since they depend on the averaged macroscopic agent density. Key issues associated with the validity of the continuum equations and interpretation of experimental data are discussed.

DT Article
DE constructivist identity theory; political identity; simulation platform
AB PS-I (Political Science-Identity) is an agent-based computer simulation platform originally developed to operationalize, refine, and test competing versions of constructivist identity theory. Based on an earlier prototype, the ABIR (Agent-Based Identity Repertoire) model, agents with repertoires of identities (or other potentialities) interact in localities of specifiable size and are influenced as well by cross-landscape values attached to particular identities. These values change over time, thereby simulating conditions in which individuals may express latent identities, or learn to use new identities, because of local pressures toward conformity and/or overall shifts in the relative attractiveness of presenting oneself as attached to one identity or another. Large batches of controlled virtual histories are used for comparative and statistical analysis. PS-I has been designed with two imperatives in mind: ease of deployment by users who know nothing of computer programming; and systematic correspondence between the algorithms for agent behavior and corroborated theoretical positions in political science and psychology. The non-technical user-the user with no programming skills-can use PS-I, to build and execute sophisticated models of substantial academic and policy interest. PS-I thus differs very significantly from existing platforms complexions and governance patterns are now under development. The substantive problems of interest that triggered the development of ABIR and PS-I related to the crisis facing social scientists using constructivist theories of identity to understand patterns of mobilization, attachment, and conflict based on cultural, ethnic, religious, or other traits. Although constructivist theory has been very successful in demonstrating the ineffectiveness of older 'primordial' or 'essentialist' notions of political identity, and in showing that identities are, within limits, fluid, tradeable, manipulable, and multiple, scholars employing these theories have been much less successful in studying the conditions under which and the limits within which collective identities can be stabilized, destabilized, created, or destroyed. The paper illustrates use of PS-I to study the dynamics of identity politics in a 'typical' authoritarian Muslim Middle Eastern country subjected to globalizing pressures, religious mobilization, and conflict in culturally divided societies.

AB This paper studies Bertrand price-setting behavior when firms face capacity constraints (Bertrand-Edgeworth game). This game is known to lack equilibria in pure strategies, while the mixed-strategy equilibria are hard to characterize. We explore families of heuristic rules for individual price-setting behavior and the resulting market patterns, through simulations of agent-based models and laboratory experiments. Overall, the individual pricing strategies observed experimentally can be represented approximately by a sales-based simple rule. In the experiments, average market prices tend to converge from above and approach a state resembling a steady state, with slow aggregate price variations and low price dispersion around an average near the competitive level. However, that configuration can be disturbed occasionally by excursions triggered by discrete price raises of some agents. Salient features of experimental results can be described by simulations where agents use sales-based heuristics with parameters calibrated from the experiments. The results obtained here suggest the existence of useful complementarities between analytical, experimental and agent-based simulation approaches. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A network of distributed agents wants to minimize a global cost given by a sum of local terms involving nonlinear convex functions of self and neighboring variables. Agents update their variables at random times by observing the values of neighboring agents and applying a random heuristic rule intent on minimizing the local cost with respect to their own variables. The heuristic rules are rational in that their average result is the actual optimal action with respect to the given values of neighboring variables. By identifying heuristic rational optimization with stochastic coordinate descent, it is shown that all agents visit a neighborhood of the optimal cost infinitely often with probability 1. An exponential probability bound on the worst deviation from optimality between visits to near optimal operating points is also derived. Commonly used models of consensus and opinion propagation in social networks, Markov random field estimation in wireless sensor networks, and cohesive foraging of animal herds are cast in the language of heuristic rational optimization. Numerical simulations for these three examples are presented to corroborate analytical results.

AB The concept of "emergence" has become commonplace in the modelling of complex systems, both natural and man-made; a functional property" emerges" from a system when it cannot be readily explained by the properties of the system's sub-units. A bewildering array of adaptive and sophisticated behaviours can be observed from large ensembles of elementary agents such as ant colonies, bird flocks or by the interactions of elementary material units such as molecules or weather elements. Ultimately, emergence has been adopted as the ontological support of a number of attempts to model brain function. This manuscript aims to clarify the ontology of emergence and delve into its many facets, particularly into its "strong" and "weak" versions that underpin two different approaches to the modelling of behaviour. The first group of models is here represented by the "free energy" principle of brain function and the "integrated information theory" of consciousness. The second group is instead represented by computational models such as oscillatory networks that use mathematical scalable representations to generate emergent behaviours and are then able to bridge neurobiology with higher mental functions. Drawing on the epistemological literature, we observe that due to their loose mechanistic links with the underlying biology, models based on strong forms of emergence are at risk of metaphysical implausibility. This, in practical terms, translates into the over determination that occurs when the proposed model becomes only one of a large set of possible explanations for the observable phenomena. On the other hand, computational models that start from biologically plausible elementary units, hence are weakly emergent, are not limited by ontological faults and, if scalable and able to realistically simulate the hierarchies of brain output, represent a powerful vehicle for future neuroscientific research programmes.

AB Tissue characterization would be facilitated by improved methods of calibration with which to make absolute measurements of the backscatter and attenuation of tissue or contrast agents, In this paper, the use of polystyrene microspheres is examined as a potential broadband in vitro calibration tool by employing an experimental system designed to characterize ultrasonic contrast agents. The frequency-dependent attenuation coefficient and backscatter coefficient were measured for a series of microsphere size distributions with a broadband ultrasound system using a custom-built specimen chamber and a novel suspension mixing technique. The measurements were used in a broadband reduction method to yield the backscatter coefficient. The range of ka spanned in this study is from ka = 0.5 to ka = 12. The broadband nature of the pulses permitted simultaneous measurement of different regimes of scattering of the microspheres (specifically, the transition region from Rayleigh to short-wavelength asymptotic scattering). Experimental results were compared with corresponding theoretical predictions for the attenuation and backscatter of solid elastic spheres in liquid and yielded good quantitative agreement. Discussion of some possible applications of this technique to the fields of tissue characterization and contrast is presented. (C) 1997 Acoustical Society of America.

AB Mathematical modeling of innovation diffusion has attracted strong academic interest since the early 1960s. Traditional diffusion models have aimed at empirical generalizations and hence describe the spread of new products parsimoniously at the market level. More recently, agent-based modeling and simulation has increasingly been adopted since it operates on the individual level and, thus, can capture complex emergent phenomena highly relevant in diffusion research. Agent-based methods have been applied in this context both as intuition aids that facilitate theory-building and as tools to analyze real-world scenarios, support management decisions and obtain policy recommendations. This review addresses both streams of research. We critically examine the strengths and limitations of agent-based modeling in the context of innovation diffusion, discuss new insights agent-based models have provided, and outline promising opportunities for future research. The target audience of the paper includes both researchers in marketing interested in new findings from the agent-based modeling literature and researchers who intend to implement agent-based models for their own research endeavors. Accordingly, we also cover pivotal modeling aspects in depth (concerning, e.g., consumer adoption behavior and social influence) and outline existing models in sufficient detail to provide a proper entry point for researchers new to the field.

AB Occurrences of crime are complex phenomena. They are the result of a large number of interrelated elements which can include environmental factors as well as complex human behaviours. Traditionally, crime occurrences have been modelled using statistical techniques, and although such approaches are useful, they face difficulties in providing predictive analyses and with the integration of behavioural information. Also, it is particularly difficult to account for the strongly influential effect of local urban form. Agent-based modelling is a relatively new modelling paradigm that has generated a considerable amount of interest. An agent is an independent component of a system which interacts with other agents and its environment to achieve goals. In this manner, large systems of agents can be created to mimic real scenarios. Most importantly, the agents can incorporate behavioural information to determine how they should achieve their goals, and models can include a highly detailed environment. This paper presents an agent-based model used to predict burglary rates, which, despite its simplicity, yields interesting results. We apply the model to the city of Leeds, UK. The model indicates that the urban configuration in Leeds is a major element in determining the level of crime across the city. It also demonstrates that agent-based modelling is an excellent tool for these types of analyses with much potential.

AB The binding of chlorosulphonated paraffins to collagen triple helices is studied by means of classical molecular dynamics simulations and experimental spectroscopic techniques in order to disclose the principal characteristics of their interaction during the leather fattening process. Indeed, collagen is the main target to develop new leather modifying agents with specific characteristics, and an accurate design of the collagen binders, supported by predictive computational strategies, could be a successful tool to obtain new effective eco-compatible compounds able to impart to the leather the required functionalities and distinctive mechanical properties. Possible effects caused by the tanning agents on the collagen matrix have been identified from both experimental and theoretical points of view. Computational data in agreement with experiment have revealed that chlorosulphonated paraffins can interact favorably with the collagen residues having amine groups in their side chains (Arg, Lys, Asn and Gln) and reduce the tendency of the solvated collagen matrix to swell. However, the interference of chlorosulphonated paraffins with the unfolding process, which is operated mainly by the action of water, can be due both to covalent cross-linking of the collagen chains and intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions involving also the hydroxyl groups of Hyp, Ser and Thr residues.

AB The formation of inclusion complexes of the water-soluble p-sulfonatocalix[n]arenes, where n = 4 or 6, with the Chemical Warfare Agent (CWA) GD, or Soman, and commonly used dialkyl methylphosphonate simulants has been studied by experimental solution NMR methods and by Molecular Mechanics (MMFF) and semi-empirical (PM6) calculations. Complex formation in non-buffered and buffered solutions is driven by the hydrophobic effect, and complex stoichiometry determined as 1:1 for all host:guest pairs. Low affinity complexes (K-assoc < 100 M-1) are observed for all guests, attributed to poor host-guest complementarity and the role of buffer cation species accounts for the low affinity of the complexes. Comparison of CWA and simulant behavior adds to understanding of CWA-simulant correlations and the challenges of simulant selection.

AB This paper builds a theoretical framework to detect the conditions under which social influence enables persistence of a shared opinion among members of an organization over time, despite membership turnover. It develops agent-based simulations of opinion evolution in an advice network, whereby opinion is defined in the broad sense of shared understandings on a matter that is relevant for an organization's activities, and on which members have some degree of discretion. We combine a micro-level model of social influence that builds on the "relative agreement" approach of Deffuant et al. (J. Artif. Soc. Simul. 5:4, 2002), and a macro-level structure of interactions that includes a flow of joiners and leavers and allows for criteria of advice tie formation derived from, and grounded in, the empirical literature on intra-organizational networks.
   We provide computational evidence that persistence of opinions over time is possible in an organization with joiners and leavers, a result that depends on circumstances defined by mode of network tie formation (in particular, criteria for selection of advisors), individual attributes of agents (openness of newcomers to influence, as part of their socialization process), and time-related factors (turnover rate, which regulates the flow of entry and exit in the organization, and establishes a form of endogenous hierarchy based on length of stay). We explore the combined effects of these factors and discuss their implications.

SO BMC BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: Organoids are morphologically heterogeneous three-dimensional cell culture systems and serve as an ideal model for understanding the principles of collective cell behaviour in mammalian organs during development, homeostasis, regeneration, and pathogenesis. To investigate the underlying cell organisation principles of organoids, we imaged hundreds of pancreas and cholangiocarcinoma organoids in parallel using light sheet and bright-field microscopy for up to 7 days.
   Results: We quantified organoid behaviour at single-cell (microscale), individual-organoid (mesoscale), and entireculture (macroscale) levels. At single-cell resolution, we monitored formation, monolayer polarisation, and degeneration and identified diverse behaviours, including lumen expansion and decline (size oscillation), migration, rotation, and multi-organoid fusion. Detailed individual organoid quantifications lead to a mechanical 3D agent-based model. A derived scaling law and simulations support the hypotheses that size oscillations depend on organoid properties and cell division dynamics, which is confirmed by bright-field microscopy analysis of entire cultures.
   Conclusion: Our multiscale analysis provides a systematic picture of the diversity of cell organisation in organoids by identifying and quantifying the core regulatory principles of organoid morphogenesis.

AB Graphic processing units (GPUs) emerged recently as an exciting new hardware environment for a truly parallel implementation and execution of Nature and Bio-inspired Algorithms with excellent price-to-power ratio. In contrast to common multicore CPUs that contain up to tens of independent cores, the GPUs represent a massively parallel single-instruction multiple-data devices that can nowadays reach peak performance of hundreds and thousands of giga floating-point operations per second. Nature and Bio-inspired Algorithms implement parallel optimization strategies in which a single candidate solution, a group of candidate solutions (population), or multiple populations seek for optimal solution or set of solutions of given problem. Genetic algorithms (GA) constitute a family of traditional and very well-known nature-inspired populational meta-heuristic algorithms that have proved its usefulness on a plethora of tasks through the years. Differential evolution (DE) is another efficient populational meta-heuristic algorithm for real-parameter optimization. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) can be seen as nature-inspired multiagent method in which the interaction of simple independent agents yields intelligent collective behavior. Simulated annealing (SA) is global optimization algorithm which combines statistical mechanics and combinatorial optimization with inspiration in metallurgy. This survey provides a brief overview of the latest state-of-the-art research on the design, implementation, and applications of parallel GA, DE, PSO, and SA-based methods on the GPUs.

ID SYSTEMS
AB In this study, we present a novel concept of a multi tethered drone system. The system includes an arbitrary number of drones connected serially to an active ground station. The considered drones are of quadrotor type. Utilizing a unique pulley-gimbal mechanism, each drone can freely move along the tether, and its state is measured with respect to the ground station without the use of standard onboard inertial sensors or GPS. The proposed system can be thought of as a robotic arm where each tether section acts as a variable-length link and each drone is a joint actuator. We model the coupled behavior of the ground station and the string, taking into account an arbitrary number of drones. Then, a controller that combines tools from geometric-control and Model Predictive Control is suggested. The developed model and control approach are also applicable for other swarm applications where the position of agents is to be controlled to a string-like form. Finally, the concept is demonstrated using numerical simulations and an initial experiment, which illustrate its potential effectiveness. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper combines agent-based modeling of structural change with agricultural policy analysis. Using the agent-based model AgriPoliS, we investigate the impact of a regime switch in agricultural policy on structural change under various framework conditions. Instead of first doing a sensitivity analysis to analyze the properties of our model and then examining the introduced policy in an isolated manner, we use a meta-modeling approach in combination with the statistical technique of Design of Experiments to systematically analyze the relationship between policy change and model assumptions regarding key determinants of structural change such as interest rates, managerial abilities, and technical change. As a result, we observe that the effects of policies are quite sensitive to the mentioned properties. We conclude that an isolated analysis of a policy regime switch would be of only minor value for policy advice given the ability of simulation models to examine various potential futures.

AB Crowd simulation has been widely used as a tool to demonstrate the behavior of passengers on public transport. A simulation model allows researchers to evaluate the platform or interior designs without involving real-world experimentation. In this paper, we propose a passenger model to measure the effect of different public transport vehicle layouts on the required time for boarding and alighting. We first model a low level collision avoidance behavior based on an extended social force model aiming at simulating human interactions in confined spaces. The model introduces a mechanism to emulate rotation behavior while avoiding complex geometric computations and is calibrated to experimental data. The model also allows agents to perform collision prediction in low density environments. Strategical behavior of passengers is modeled according to the recognition-primed decision paradigm and combined with the collision avoidance model. We validate our model against real-world experiments from the literature, demonstrating deviations of less than 6%. In a case study, we evaluate the boarding and alighting times required by three autonomous vehicle interior layouts proposed by industrial designers in both low-density and high-density scenarios.

DE Food rescue; Agent-based modeling; Crowd-shipping
ID MODEL
AB Purpose The purpose of this research is to gain a better understanding of how a crowd-shipping platform can achieve a critical mass of senders and carrier crowd members to yield network effects that are necessary for the platform to grow and thrive. Specifically, this research studies the participation decisions of both senders and carriers over time and the impacts of the resulting feedback loop on platform growth and performance. Design/methodology/approach An agent-based model is developed and used to study dynamic behavior and network effects within a simulated crowd-shipping platform. The model allows both carriers and senders to be represented as autonomous, heterogeneous and adaptive agents, whose decisions to participate in the platform impact the participation of other agents over time. Survey data inform the logic governing agent decisions and behaviors. Findings The feedback loop created by individual sender and carrier agents' participation decisions generates complex and dynamic network effects that are observable at the platform level. Experimental results demonstrate the importance of having sufficient crowd carriers available when the platform is initially launched, as well as ensuring that sender and carrier participation remains balanced as the platform grows over time. Research limitations/implications The model successfully demonstrates the power of agent-based modeling (ABM) in analyzing network effects in crowd-shipping systems. However, the model has not yet been fully validated with data from a real-world crowd-shipping platform. Furthermore, the model's geographic scope is limited to a single census tract. Platform behavior will likely differ across geographic regions, with varying demographics and sender/carrier density. Practical implications The modeling approach can be used to provide the manager of a volunteer-based crowd-shipping program for food rescue with insights on how to achieve a critical mass of participants, with an appropriate balance between the number of restaurant food donation delivery requests and the number of crowd-shippers available and willing to make those deliveries. Social implications This research can help a crowd-shipping platform for urban food rescue to grow and become self-sustainable, thereby serving more food-insecure people. Originality/value The model represents both senders and the carrier crowd as autonomous, heterogeneous and adaptive agents, such that network effects resulting from their interactions can emerge and be observed over time. The model was designed to study a volunteer crowd-shipping platform for food rescue, with participant motivations driven by personal values and social factors, rather than monetary incentives.

TI A new intelligent agent-based strategy for constrained multiple

SO COMPUTER JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID STEINER PROBLEM; MULTICAST; ALGORITHMS; COMMUNICATION; NETWORKS
AB The Multiple Destination Routing (MDR) problem can be formulated as finding a minimum cost Steiner tree that satisfies certain constraints in a given communication network. This problem is known to be computationally intractable, as it is a typical NP-hard problem. In this paper, a new intelligent agent-based algorithm is developed to solve the MDR problem in large networks. The algorithm describes an efficient integration and adoption of mobile agents and swarm optimization for the construction of constrained multicast trees. The proposed strategy is based on a group of autonomous agents that traverse the network in an intelligent and parallel manner forming an adaptive search. Routing decisions can be made on the basis of local information about the current network state and the knowledge constructed by a previous set of behaviours of other agents. The advantages of such a paradigm are fault tolerance against some network dynamics, the ability to find optimal regions in complex search spaces through the interaction of individuals in a population of agents and a reduction in the congestion at busy network nodes by favouring paths of low traffic load. The proposed algorithm demonstrated good performance and robustness under all the experimental conditions in comparison to its competitors. The simulation study for both sparse and dense networks showed that the proposed algorithm is highly robust and efficient in the sense of rapidly yielding high-quality solutions.

AB We introduce a variant of the Axelrod model of cultural dissemination in which agents change their physical locations, social links, and cultures. Numerical simulations are used to investigate the evolution of social network communities and the cultural diversity within and between these communities. An analysis of the simulation results shows that an initial peak in the cultural diversity within network communities is evident before agents segregate into a final configuration of culturally homogeneous communities. Larger long-range interaction probabilities facilitate the initial emergence of culturally diverse network communities, which leads to a more pronounced initial peak in cultural diversity within communities. At equilibrium, the number of communities, and hence cultures, increases when the initial cultural diversity increases. However, the number of communities decreases when the lattice size or population density increases. A phase transition between two regimes of initial cultural diversity is evident. For initial diversities below a critical value, a single network community and culture emerges that dominates the population. For initial diversities above the critical value, multiple culturally homogeneous communities emerge. The critical value of initial diversity at which this transition occurs increases with increasing lattice size and population density and generally with increasing absolute population size. We conclude that larger initial diversities promote cultural heterogenization, while larger lattice sizes, population densities, and in fact absolute population sizes promote homogenization.

AB The study investigates fundamental mechanisms generating issue-attention cycles in news coverage with a social simulation approach. An agent-based computer model is developed, which integrates the main drivers of news waves as identified by empirical research. By simulating the model many times under varying conditions, the interaction of the factors to generate the typical issue-attention cycle can be observed. Results suggest that the momentum of news waves is mainly driven by the adaptive reporting behavior of journalists. Sponsors actively supporting issues by initiating events are not necessary to generate issue-attention cycles, but change their typical dynamics. Comparing simulated time series to two empirical cases yields that the model produces more realistic patterns of media attention when issue sponsors are introduced.

AB In this paper we introduce a mathematical model to study the group dynamics of birds resting on wires. The model is agent-based and postulates attraction-repulsion forces between the interacting birds: the interactions are "topological", in the sense that they involve a given number of neighbors irrespective of their distance. The model is first mathematically analyzed and then simulated to study its main properties: we observe that the model predicts birds to be more widely spaced near the borders of each group. We compare the results from the model with experimental data, derived from the analysis of pictures of pigeons and starlings taken in New Jersey: two different image elaboration protocols allow us to establish a good agreement with the model and to quantify its main parameters. We also discuss the potential handedness of the birds, by analyzing the group organization features and the group dynamics at the arrival of new birds. Finally, we propose a more refined mathematical model that describes landing and departing birds by suitable stochastic processes.

AB In many real-world systems, agents' behaviors are usually coupled with environmental changes. To model their coevolutionary process, we study a non-equilibrium model known as majority vote model coupled with reaction-diffusion processes on a two-layer multiplex network. The dynamics of the noise parameter in noise layer is related to the voting behavior and represents the increase and decrease of social tension in the context of social dynamics. Weperform Monte Carlo simulations and finitesize scaling analysis in order to investigate the statistical behavior of the model. It is interesting to find that our coupling mechanism induces a continuous order-disorder phase transition on random regular graphs, but the critical phenomenon disappears on square lattices. Besides, switching from one sign of the spontaneous magnetization to the opposite is also observed near the critical region. Given specific parameters, the system may self-organize to a critical state from any initial conditions. In addition, a mean-field method is developed to study the properties of the phase transition analytically and the solutions are in good agreement with our numerical results qualitatively.

AB To evaluate the influence of crystalline structure on the mechanical behavior of polypropylene (PP), uniaxial tensile cyclic tests with a mixed program (oscillations between fixed maximum strains and the zero minimum stress) were performed on isotactic PP (iPP) manufactured by the Ziegler-Natta catalysis method, metallocene catalyzed PP (mPP), and annealed mPP. Although the stress-strain diagrams of iPP and mPP under tension are quite similar, their responses under unloading differ markedly. The residual strain (measured as the strain under retraction down to the zero stress) of iPP strongly exceeds that of non-annealed mPP, and annealing of mPP increases this difference. To rationalize these findings, constitutive equations are developed in cyclic viscoelasticity and viscoplasticity of semicrystalline polymers, and adjustable parameters in the stress-strain relations are found by fitting the observations. The ability of the model to describe the observed phenomenon and to predict the mechanical response in multi-cycle tensile tests, with various deformation programs, is demonstrated by numerical simulation.

AB Experimental econophysics is concerned with statistical physics of humans in the laboratory, and it is based on controlled human experiments developed by physicists to study some problems related to economics or finance. It relies on controlled human experiments in the laboratory together with agent-based modeling (for computer simulations and/or analytical theory), with an attempt to reveal the general cause-effect relationship between specific conditions and emergent properties of real economic/financial markets (a kind of complex adaptive systems). Here I review the latest progress in the field, namely, stylized facts, herd behavior, contrarian behavior, spontaneous cooperation, partial information, and risk management. Also, I highlight the connections between such progress and other topics of traditional statistical physics. The main theme of the review is to show diverse emergent properties of the laboratory markets, originating from self-organization due to the nonlinear interactions among heterogeneous humans or agents (complexity).

AB This paper presents an experimental examination of Kiyotaki and Wright's (1989) model of how money can arise as a medium of exchange. While the results generally support the hypothesis that individuals are willing to utilize a good as a medium of exchange, the trading patterns of a portion of the individuals deviated from the predicted patterns. Simulation studies suggest that while these deviations may have initially been a rational response by these subjects, they persisted after they became less than optimal.

AB Massive diffusion of green technologies is significant for building a cleaner world. However, the process of technology diffusion is usually slow and complex. An in-depth understanding of the mechanism regarding green technology diffusion is an essential precondition for effectively stimulating this process. Green technology diffusion heavily involves both social and technological changes. Although existing studies have provided rich knowledge about identifying critical drivers and barriers affecting green technology diffusion, research that considers consumers' pro-environmental attitudes and green technology diffusion as an evolving system is still sparse. Aiming at exploring the co-evolution of consumers' pro-environmental attitudes and green technology diffusion, this paper builds an agent-based model that integrates the relative agreement model with technology diffusion theories to conduct a sequence of controlled numerical experiments, which progressively unveil how attitudinal and technological factors impact green technology diffusion. The main findings include that (1) improving consumers' pro-environmental attitudes is prominently beneficial to green technology diffusion and maturation; (2) technology maturity has very limited impact on consumers' first-time purchases but significantly affects consumers' satisfaction, which would further impact consumers' repeat purchases; (3) consumers that do not support green technologies frequently emerge during the evolution of attitudes (despite the high technology maturity), which corresponds to the emergence of the anti-environmental groups observed in the real world; (4) active interactions between non-adopters enable their attitudes to converge, which results in the polarization of consumers' attitudes.

AB This paper reports extensive experimental study done to compare workability and bond strength of five different types of polymer-based bonding agents for reinforcing bars in pinning retrofit. In pinning retrofit, steel pins of 6 to 10 mm diameters are inserted into holes drilled diagonally from mortar joints. This technique is superior to other techniques especially in retrofitting historic masonry constructions because it does not change the appearance of constructions. With an ordinary cement paste as bonding agent, it is very difficult to insert reinforcing bars at larger open times due to poor workability and very thin clearance available. Here, open time represents the time interval between the injection of bonding agent and the insertion of reinforcing bars. Use of polymer-cement paste (PCP), as bonding agent, is proposed in this study, with investigation on workability and bond strengths of various PCPs in brick masonry, at open times up to 10 minutes, which is unavoidable in practice. Corresponding nonlinear finite element models are developed to simulate the experimental observations. From the experimental and analytical study, the Styrene-Butadiene Rubber polymer-cement paste (SBR-PCP) with prior pretreatments of drilled holes showed strong bond with minimum strength variation at larger open times.

AB Activity-based analysis has slowly shifted gear from the analysis of daily activity patterns to the analysis and modeling of dynamic activity-travel patterns. In this paper, we address one type of dynamics: the formation and adaptation of location choice sets under influence of dyad relationships within social networks. It extends the dynamic model developed in earlier work, which simulates habitual behavior versus exploitation and exploration as a function of discrepancies between dynamic, context-dependent aspiration levels and expected outcomes. Principles of social comparison and knowledge transfer are used in modeling the impact of social networks through information exchange, adaptations of spatial choice sets and formation of common aspiration levels. We demonstrate model properties using numerical simulation with a case study of shopping activities. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Opinion dynamics is one of the most studied problems in sociophysics. Many easy-to-analyze dynamical systems are modeled in a language of agent-based numerical procedures in order to provide new insights for understanding collective phenomena.
   The present work is devoted to analyze the effects of spatial heterogeneities in the initial topological map of agent ideas. In the spirit of the statistical physics of social impact, we study the consequences of running a Sznajd model into a structured opinion formation dynamics of a given social community. We carry out a spatio-temporal fractal analysis of the ideological configuration map, showing novel features belonging to different initial conditions. By performing numerical simulations, we mainly show how the evolution of ideas can lead to a spontaneous emergence of a third ideological position. This emergence is just characterized by few parameters: the dimensionality of the initial ideological structures and the interaction dynamics. No additional external constraints are assumed. Moreover, different emergent behaviors in the limit of high participation apathy are observed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Binge drinking is a complex social problem linked to an array of detrimental health effects. While binge drinking in youth has been analyzed extensively using traditional methods (e.g., regressions analyses), the adult population has received less attention, and recent work has exemplified the potential for simulations to help scholars and practitioners better understand the problem. In this paper, we used agent-based social network models to test a number of hypotheses on important aspects of binge drinking in a sample representative of the adult Dutch population. In particular, we found that a combination of simple social rules (choosing peers who are similar, being prompted to drink if at least a fraction of them drinks, and incorporating the context) was sufficient to correctly predict the behaviour of half of the binge drinkers and 4 out of 5 non binge drinkers. Furthermore, we used factorial analyses to examine the contribution and combination of hypotheses in predicting the behaviour of individuals, with results indicating that who we interact with may not matter so much as how we interact. Finally, we evaluated the potential for interventions that mediate interactions between people in order to reduce the prevalence of binge drinking and found that the impact of such interventions was non linear: moderate interventions would yield benefits, but stronger interventions may only be of limited further benefit.

AB We develop a model for describing the dynamics of imatinib-treated chronic myelogenous leukemia. Our model is based on replacing the recent agent-based model of Roeder et al. (Nat. Med. 12(10):1181-1184, 2006) by a system of deterministic difference equations. These difference equations describe the time-evolution of clusters of individual agents that are grouped by discretizing the state space. Hence, unlike standard agent-base models, the complexity of our model is independent of the number of agents, which allows to conduct simulation studies with a realistic number of cells. This approach also allows to directly evaluate the expected steady states of the system. The results of our numerical simulations show that our model replicates the averaged behavior of the original Roeder model with a significantly reduced computational cost. Our general approach can be used to simplify other similar agent-based models. In particular, due to the reduced computational complexity of our technique, one can use it to conduct sensitivity studies of the parameters in large agent-based systems.

TI Modeling and Simulation on Static and Fatigue Behaviors of Intact and
   Frost Damaged Concrete with Ice-strengthening Effects
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED CONCRETE TECHNOLOGY

ID MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; MESOSCALE SIMULATION; DEFORMATION; MORTAR
AB Concrete structures serving in cold and wet regions usually suffer frost damage and thus have server deterioration. Many researches have been conducted to reveal the damaging mechanism and damaged mechanical properties of concrete under the effect of frost action. It has been widely known that the strength and stiffness of frost damaged concrete without using air-entraining agent decrease under room temperature. However, there will be a different story if the frost-damaged concrete is saturated and loaded under freezing temperature. Water existing in pores and cracks will freeze into ice, which provides additional strengthening effects. This paper presents a multi-scale modeling and simulation work on the static and fatigue behaviors of frost damaged concrete with consideration of such ice-strengthening effects. The micro-mesoscale damaging and strengthening effects induced by ice formation are modeled and integrated into the mesoscale analytical approach - Rigid Body Spring Model, and the macroscale static and fatigue behaviors are simulated. It is found that the freezing temperature has a positive (strengthening) effect on the static strength, while it has a negative effect on the fatigue life for both intact and frost-damaged concrete. Test is also conducted with available experimental evidence to validate the developed approach. Satisfactory correlation is found through the comparison between simulation and experiment.

ID FUNCTIONING AUTISM; QUOTIENT
AB Social skills training, performed by human trainers, is a well-established method for obtaining appropriate skills in social interaction. Previous work automated the process of social skills training by developing a dialogue system that teaches social communication skills through interaction with a computer avatar. Even though previous work that simulated social skills training only considered acoustic and linguistic information, human social skills trainers take into account visual and other non-verbal features. In this paper, we create and evaluate a social skills training system that closes this gap by considering the audiovisual features of the smiling ratio and the head pose (yaw and pitch). In addition, the previous system was only tested with graduate students; in this paper, we applied our system to children or young adults with autism spectrum disorders. For our experimental evaluation, we recruited 18 members from the general population and 10 people with autism spectrum disorders and gave them our proposed multimodal system to use. An experienced human social skills trainer rated the social skills of the users. We evaluated the system's effectiveness by comparing pre- and post-training scores and identified significant improvement in their social skills using our proposed multimodal system. Computer-based social skills training is useful for people who experience social difficulties. Such a system can be used by teachers, therapists, and social skills trainers for rehabilitation and the supplemental use of human-based training anywhere and anytime.

AB This paper presents the results of an experimental study to understand the dominant mechanism in bond strength between dental resin agent and zirconia ceramic by investigating the effects of different surface treatments. Effects of two major mechanisms of chemical and micromechanical adhesion were evaluated on bond strength of zirconia to luting agent. Specimens of yttrium-oxide-partially-stabilized zirconia blocks were fabricated. Seven groups of specimens with different surface treatment were prepared. 1) zirconia specimens after airborne particle abrasion (SZ), 2) zirconia specimens after etching (ZH), 3) zirconia specimens after airborne particle abrasion and simultaneous etching (HSZ), 4) zirconia specimens coated with a layer of a Fluorapatite-Leucite glaze (GZ), 5) GZ specimens with additional acid etching (HGZ), 6) zirconia specimens coated with a layer of salt glaze (SGZ) and 7) SGZ specimens after etching with 2% HCl (HSGZ). Composite cylinders were bonded to airborne-particle-abraded surfaces of ZirkonZahn specimens with Panavia F2 resin luting agent Failure modes were examined under 30x magnification and the effect of surface treatments was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). SZ and HSZ groups had the highest and GZ and SGZ groups had the lowest mean shear bond strengths among all groups. Mean shear bond strengths were significantly decreased by applying a glaze layer on zirconia surfaces in GZ and SGZ groups. However, bond strengths were improved after etching process. Airborne particle abrasion resulted in higher shear bond strengths compared to etching treatment Modes of failure varied among different groups. Finally, it is concluded that micromechanical adhesion was a more effective mechanism than chemical adhesion and airborne particle abrasion significantly increased mean shear bond strengths compared with another surface treatments.

AB In this paper, we investigate the optimal deployment problems for a group of dynamic unicycles in a given region. The information of interests over this region is considered such that the region with higher interests can get more attentions. Firstly, we present a cost function to describe the performance of multi-unicycle systems and find out the optimal locations for unicycles. Then, we transform this information-based optimal deployment problem into a moving target tracking problem and propose a novel kinematic control protocol to drive unicycles to the optimal locations. On this basis, an algorithm is provided for the dynamic unicycles by using the back-stepping techniques. Moreover, we demonstrate the stability and convergence of the proposed multi-unicycle systems. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

AB A stochastic biogeochemical model has been developed to simulate the transformation and degradation of natural organic matter (NOM) using an agent-based algorithm which treats each molecule as a separate and potentially unique entity. Molecules react when a pseudo-random number is lower than the calculated reaction probability in a given time step; repeated time steps simulate the transformation of precursor molecules into a complex NOM assemblage. The data for each molecule-elemental and functional group composition-can be used to calculate many properties directly and exactly for each molecule in the assemblage, e.g., molecular weight (MW), fraction of aromatic C (Ar), and charge at pH 7 (Z). Empirical quantitative structure activity relationships (QSARs) are developed which permit the estimation of thermodynamic quantities K (ow) (the octanol-water partition coefficient) and pK (a) (acidity) for each molecule. Root mean square errors for these QSARs are 0.39 log units for log K (ow) and 0.45 log units for pK (a). Distributions of both exactly calculated (MW, Ar, Z) and estimated thermodynamic (K (ow), pK (a)) properties are examined and compared with published experimental data. Molecular weight distributions from size exclusion HPLC experiments on aquatic NOM are quantitatively similar to simulation results. pH titrations and polarity distributions from reversed-phase HPLC are qualitatively similar to simulation results. This agreement suggests that the agent-based model can be used to explore hypotheses regarding both compositional and thermodynamic properties of NOM.

AB In this study, the authors deal with a formation of autonomous mobile agents in the distance-based formation control setup, where the formation is represented by a directed cycle. They use gradient control law to stabilise the mobile agents and provide analysis of the behaviour of the agents under the given control law. Although a particular formation shape cannot be achieved by controlling only the inter-agent distances with more than three agents in the plane, at least they can make the inter-agent distances converge to the desired distances and stabilise the agents so that they converge. They found that there are invariant subsets where the agents may not achieve desired distances. However, they show that those invariant sets are not attractive. Simulation results and experimental results verifying their analysis are provided.

AB The sustainable use of common pool resources has become a significant global challenge. It is now widely accepted that specific mechanisms such as community-based management strategies, institutional responses such as resource privatization, information availability and emergent social norms can be used to constrain individual 'harvesting' to socially optimal levels. However, there is a paucity of research focused specifically on aligning profitability and sustainability goals. In this paper, an integrated mathematical model of a common pool resource game is developed to explore the nexus between the underlying costs and benefits of harvesting decisions and the sustainable level of a shared, dynamic resource. We derive optimal harvesting efforts analytically and then use numerical simulations to show that individuals in a group can learn to make harvesting decisions that lead to the globally optimal levels. Individual agents make their decision based on signals received and a trade-off between economic and ecological sustainability. When the balance is weighted towards profitability, acceptable economic and social outcomes emerge. However, if individual agents are solely driven by profit, the shared resource is depleted in the long run - sustainability is possible despite some greed, but too much will lead to over-exploitation.

ID NETWORKS
AB Using agent-directed simulations, we investigate fluctuations in the collective emotional states on a chat network where agents interchange messages with a fixed number of moderators and emotional Bot. To design a realistic chat system, the interaction rules and some statistical parameters, as well as the agent's attributed, are inferred from the empirical chat channel Ubuntu. In the simulations, the Bot's emotion is fixed; the moderators tune the level of its activity by passing a fraction epsilon of messages to the Bot. At epsilon greater than or similar to 0, the collective emotional state matching the Bot's emotion polarity gradually arises; the average growth rate of the dominant emotional charge serves as an order parameter. Due to self-organizing effects, the collective dynamics is more explosive when positive emotions arise by positive Bot than the onset of negative emotions in the presence of negative Bot at the same epsilon. Furthermore, when the emotions matching the Bot's emotion polarity are spread over the system, the underlying fractal processes exhibit higher persistence and stronger clustering of events than the processes spreading of emotion polarity opposite to the Bot's emotion. On the other hand, the relaxation dynamics is controlled by the external noise; the related nonextensive parameter, estimated from the statistics of returns, is virtually independent of the Bot's activity level and emotion contents.

AB A transport-complex model has been established to correlate the experimental absorption curves of epoxy resin (epoxy) and urethane acrylate resin(UAR) simultaneous interpenetrating networks (SINs) with ethanol as the diffusion agent, The experimental results show that the simulative curves calculated can be correlated by using the complex model well enough with the experimental data in general and the physical meaning of correlating coefficient omega(r) is expressed as the ability of migration of ethanol through the networks after it makes hydrogen bond with urethane, ester or ether groups existing in the networks, Consequently it directly responds to the structures and morphologies of the SINs, The parameters measured including the solubility constant S, average diffusion coefficient D and penetrating weight P are all related to the composition of such SINs. It clearly exhibits that ethanol mainly transports through the UAR phase.

AB Bats navigating with echolocation - which is a type of active sensing achieved by interpreting echoes resulting from self-generated ultrasonic pulses - exhibit unique behaviors during group flight. While bats may benefit from eavesdropping on their peers' echolocation, they also potentially suffer from confusion between their own and peers' pulses, caused by an effect called frequency jamming. This hardship of group flight is supported by experimental observations of bats simplifying their sound-scape by shifting their pulse frequencies or suppressing echolocation altogether. Here, we investigate eavesdropping and varying pulse emission rate from a modeling perspective to understand these behaviors' potential benefits and detriments. We define an agent-based model of echolocating bats avoiding collisions in a three-dimensional tunnel. Through simulation, we show that bats with reasonably accurate eavesdropping can reduce collisions compared to those neglecting information from peers. In large populations, bats minimize frequency jamming by decreasing pulse emission rate, while collision risk increases; conversely, increasing pulse emission rate minimizes collisions by allowing more sensing information generated per bat. These strategies offer benefits for both biological and engineered systems, since frequency jamming is a concern in systems using active sensing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A broad cross-section of the social sciences is increasingly turning to biology and evolutionary theory to help explain human behavior. Political science is a notable exception to this trend, even though there are sound conceptual reasons for expecting biological processes to play an important role in explaining political behavior. While agreeing with the conceptual arguments, the authors believe original empirical research is the most persuasive means of convincing political science to incorporate biology in explanations of political behavior. Techniques developed in neuroscience, behavioral genetics, agent-based simulation, experimental economics and other fields offer exciting research opportunities to explore questions of central interest to political scientists. The research presented in this volume provides examples of replicable, empirical evidence that political beliefs and behavior are a product of biological as well as environmental factors.

AB Objectives: Several recent publications have suggested an association between the administration of gadolinium (Gd)-based contrast agents and the occurrence of Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis (NSF), an acquired disorder marked by skin thickening and fibrosis occurring in patients with severe renal dysfunction. The aim of this study was to establish a preclinical experimental setting to investigate the possible link between NSF and Gd-based contrast agents, and specifically the role of Gd and/or depletion of endogenous metal ions as possible triggers for NSF.
   Materials and Methods: Thirty-five healthy male rats received repeated intravenous injections of Magnevist (gadopentetate dimeglumine; Gd-DTPA), Omniscan (gadodiamide; Gd-DTPA-BMA), or gadodiamide without caldiamide at a dose of 2.5 mmol Gd/kg body weight over at least 20 days to simulate the exposure to Gd-containing contrast agents in patients with severe renal dysfunction. In addition, caldiamide (the excess ligand in Omniscan) and Gd-ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (Gd-EDTA) as a positive control, and saline as a negative control were studied. Histopathologic and immuohistochemical analysis of the skin was performed. Gd and zinc concentrations were measured in skin, femur, and liver tissue by atomic emission spectrometry.
   Results: Rats receiving Gd-EDTA, gadodiamide without caldiamide, and Omniscan developed epidermal ulceration and acanthosis, dermo-epidermal clefts, mini mal-to-slight dermal fibrosis, and increased dermal infiltration of different cells, partly positive for CD34 fibrocytes. No such NSF-like macroscopic lesions were observed in the saline, caldiamide, and Magnevist groups. High Gd concentrations in the skin were found in the Gd-EDTA, gadodiamide without caldiamide, and Omniscan groups. In the Magnevist group, Gd levels in the skin were 10-times lower than in the Omniscan-treated animals but elevated compared with saline.
   Conclusions: A preclinical experimental setting has been established where NSF-like lesions could be observed. The link between the application of Gd-based contrast media and the induction of NSF-like lesions was established. The data indicate that the observed skin lesions are related to the release of Gd and not to the depletion of endogenous ions. The investigations further suggest potential importance of the stability of Gd-based contrast agents.

AB Wettability of porous media plays an important role in effecting multiphase flow, which provides a clue to modify percolating process in porous media. The objective of this work is to study the effects of wettability on fluids flow and its applications in oil fields. Firstly, the effect of wettability on oil recovery was analyzed by experimental data. Secondly, the wettability alteration induced by wettability control agents was studied by experimental approach. Thirdly, a two-phase flow mathematical model considering wettability control by chemical agents is presented. Finally, a numerical simulator considering wettability control was developed and oil field examples were run on the simulator and the percolation behaviors of two-phase flow were predicted. Numerical simulations show that the treatment of increasing water-wetting wettability control agent (IWWCA) leads to 15.38% more in oil recovery than that of normal water displacement. Increasing oil-wetting wettability control agent (IOWCA) improves 60% to 80% more in water injection rates. It was found that the concentration of IWWCA has an obvious effect on oil recovery when IWWCA concentration is less than 0.02. IOWCA treatments of 6 oil-field injection wells show that average water injection capacity increases up to 2.75 times of their initial injection capacity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID PSEUDOMONAS-AERUGINOSA BIOFILMS; MASS-TRANSPORT; LIQUID FLOW;
   SUSCEPTIBILITY
AB A mathematical model of the action of antimicrobial agents on bacterial biofilms is presented. The model includes the fluid dynamics in and around the biofilm, advective and diffusive transport of two chemical constituents and the mechanism of physiological resistance. Although the mathematical model applies in three dimensions, we present two-dimensional simulations for arbitrary biofilm domains and various dosing strategies. The model allows the prediction of the spatial evolution of bacterial population and chemical constituents as well as different dosing strategies based on the fluid motion. We find that the interaction between the nutrient and the antimicrobial agent can reproduce survival curves which are comparable to other model predictions as well as experimental results. The model predicts that exposing the biofilm to low concentration doses of antimicrobial agent for longer time is more effective than short time dosing with high antimicrobial agent concentration. The effects of flow reversal and the roughness of the fluid/biofilm are also investigated. We find that reversing the flow increases the effectiveness of dosing. In addition, we show that overall survival decreases with increasing surface roughness. (c) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Society for Mathematical Biology.

AB Purpose: Performance status (PS) is one of the most common eligibility criteria. Many trials are limited to patients with high-functioning PS, resulting in important differences between trial participants and patient populations with the disease. In addition, existing PS measures are subjective and susceptible to investigator bias.
   Experimental Design: A multidisciplinary working group of the American Society of Clinical Oncology and Friends of Cancer Research evaluated how PS eligibility criteria could be more inclusive. The working group recommendations are based on a literature search, review of trials, simulation study, and multistakeholder consensus. The working group prioritized inclusiveness and access to investigational therapies, while balancing patient safety and study integrity.
   Results: Broadening PS eligibility criteria may increase the number of potentially eligible patients for a given clinical trial, thus shortening accrual time. It may also result in greater participant diversity, potentially reduce trial participant and patient disparities, and enable clinicians to more readily translate trial results to patients with low-functioning PS. Potential impact on outcomes was explored through a simulation trial demonstrating that when the number of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group PS2 participants was relatively small, the effect on the estimated HR and power was modest, even when PS2 patients did not derive a treatment benefit.
   Conclusions: Expanding PS eligibility criteria to be more inclusive may be justified in many cases and could result in faster accrual rates and more representative trial populations.

This paper proposes an Agent-based Model simulation for analyzing land occupation scenarios from people's spatial perception and behavior that are coded through fuzzy logic. Agent-based Model is a recent simulation approach, which involves reproducing a real world system into a virtual one, where experiments shall be performed. In the virtual universe, each agent is represented by an independent entity that is capable of acting locally in response to its perception, coded behavior and environmental changes. Fuzzy logic, in addiction, has been used with relative success to handle real world uncertainty and linguistic terms in computational systems. A prototype of this hybrid model has demonstrated its viability as well as its ability to handle people's spatial perception and behavior. A study case verifies the model potential application in studies and predictions of land occupation in a coastal area, including hypothesis test of each actor's role in the system functioning.

AB Objectives: To investigate in situ and in vitro effects of acidic and neutral in-office bleaching agents on human enamel in terms of chemical structure and tooth color.
   Methods: Ninety enamel slabs were obtained from premolars. Then specimens were randomly distributed into six groups (n = 15) and the human saliva (HS) in volunteers' oral cavities was used to simulate in situ condition: group Beyond + distilled water (DW); group Opalescence Boost (O-Boost) + DW; group control + DW; group Beyond + HS; group O-Boost + HS and group control + HS. Twice in-office bleaching treatments were performed with a one-week interval and the total bleaching time was 90 min. ATR-IR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and color measurement were performed before the bleaching treatment and after one week post-treatment, respectively. Then ATR-IR and Raman spectroscopies were analysed and the carbonate: mineral (C:M) ratio, Raman absolute intensity (RAI), Raman relative intensity (RRI) and laser-induced fluorescence intensity (FI) were calculated for evaluation.
   Results: C:M ratio and percentage RRI showed significantly decrease in group Beyond + DW (p < 0.001, p < 0.001) while little variation was observed in the other groups (p > 0.05, p > 0.05). Percentage FI and Delta E revealed statistical difference in all bleached groups (p < 0.001, p < 0.001) while no statistical difference in control groups (p > 0.05, p > 0.05).
   Conclusion: Acidic and neutral in-office bleaching agents had the same whitening efficiency in situ and in vitro. Acidic agents could induce demineralisation of human enamel in vitro and the presence of natural human saliva could minimise this adverse effect. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A compositionality-regularity coevolution model is adopted to explore the effect of social structure on language emergence and maintenance. Based on this model, we explore language evolution in three experiments, and discuss the role of a popular agent in language evolution, the relationship between mutual understanding and social hierarchy, and the effect of inter-community communications and that of simple linguistic features on convergence of communal languages in two communities. This work embodies several important interactions during social learning, and introduces a new approach that manipulates individuals' probabilities to participate in social interactions to study the effect of social structure. We hope it will stimulate further theoretical and empirical explorations on language evolution in a social environment.

ID SOCIAL FORCE MODEL
AB Many agent based simulation approaches have been proposed for pedestrian flow. As such models are applied e.g. in evacuation studies, the quality and reliability of such models is of vital interest, Pedestrian trajectories are functional data and thus functional principal component analysis is a natural tool to assess the quality of pedestrian flow models beyond average properties. In this article we conduct functional Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for the trajectories of pedestrians passing through a bottleneck. In this way it is possible to assess the quality of the models not only on basis of average values but also by considering its fluctuations. We benchmark two agent based models of pedestrian flow against the experimental data using PCA average and stochastic features. Functional PCA proves to be an efficient tool to detect deviation between simulation and experiment and to assess quality of pedestrian models. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Mass transfer models for the electrodeposition of copper with a
   buffering agent
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
AB A model based on physical phenomena has been developed to improve the filling by pulse plating of copper into high aspect ratio features by using a copper complex which dissolves in solution and acts as a buffering agent. Mass transfer pulse-plating models are formulated to account for this effect and solved numerically to show the competition between step coverage and deposition rate. An important parameter, the Damkohler number, applied to filling nanoscale features for the first time, has been identified from the model and its effect on step coverage and deposition rate has been systematically studied. An analytical model is also developed that assumes linear deposition kinetics and neglects boundary movement due to deposition. It describes the initial part of the fill and is used to obtain important trends to guide the numerical simulations. A new criterion, based on the pulse-plating parameters, to obtain the optimal plating conditions has also been developed. I-D and 2-D profile simulations are performed to demonstrate the significant improvement in gap filling in the presence of a buffering agent. Copper has been deposited into submicrometer features using an alkaline ammoniacal bath. Model results have been compared to experimental observations with good correlation between them.

AB Two nonlinear interfacial elasticity models-interfacial elasticity decreasing linearly and exponentially with area fraction-are developed for the encapsulation of contrast microbubbles. The strain softening (decreasing elasticity) results from the decreasing association between the constitutive molecules of the encapsulation. The models are used to find the characteristic properties (surface tension, interfacial elasticity, interfacial viscosity and nonlinear elasticity parameters) for a commercial contrast agent. Properties are found using the ultrasound attenuation measured through a suspension of contrast agent. Dynamics of the resulting models are simulated, compared with other existing models and discussed. Imposing non-negativity on the effective surface tension (the encapsulation experiences no net compressive stress) shows "compression-only" behavior. The exponential and the quadratic (linearly varying elasticity) models result in similar behaviors. The validity of the models is investigated by comparing their predictions of the scattered nonlinear response for the contrast agent at higher excitations against experimental measurement. All models predict well the scattered fundamental response. The nonlinear strain softening included in the proposed elastic models of the encapsulation improves their ability to predict subharmonic response. They predict the threshold excitation for the initiation of subharmonic response and its subsequent saturation. (C) 2010 Acoustical Society of America. [DOI: 10.1121/1.3418685]

AB We propose an evolutionary snowdrift game model for heterogeneous systems with two types of agents, in which the inner-directed agents adopt the memory-based updating rule while the copycat-like ones take the unconditional imitation rule; moreover, each agent can change his type to adopt another updating rule once the number he sequentially loses the game at is beyond his upper limit of tolerance. The cooperative behaviors of such heterogeneous systems are then investigated by Monte Carlo simulations. The numerical results show the equilibrium cooperation frequency and composition as functions of the cost-to-benefit ratio r are both of plateau structures with discontinuous steplike jumps, and the number of plateaux varies non-monotonically with the upper limit of tolerance v(T) as well as the initial composition of agents f(a0). Besides, the quantities of the cooperation frequency and composition are dependent crucially on the system parameters including v(T), f(a0), and r. One intriguing observation is that when the upper limit of tolerance is small, the cooperation frequency will be abnormally enhanced with the increase of the cost-to-benefit ratio in the range of 0 < r < 1/4. We then probe into the relative cooperation frequencies of either type of agents, which are also of plateau structures dependent on the system parameters. Our results may be helpful to understand the cooperative behaviors of heterogenous agent systems.

AB Archaeology, linguistics, and increasingly genetics are clarifying how populations moved from mainland Asia, through Island Southeast Asia, and out into the Pacific during the farming revolution. Yet key features of this process remain poorly understood, particularly how social behaviors intersected with demographic drivers to create the patterns of genomic diversity observed across Island Southeast Asia today. Such questions are ripe for computer modeling. Here, we construct an agent-based model to simulate human mobility across Island Southeast Asia from the Neolithic period to the present, with a special focus on interactions between individuals with Asian, Papuan, and mixed Asian-Papuan ancestry. Incorporating key features of the region, including its complex geography (islands and sea), demographic drivers (fecundity and migration), and social behaviors (marriage preferences), the model simultaneously tracks a full suite of genomic markers (autosomes, X chromosome, mitochondrial DNA, and Y chromosome). Using Bayesian inference, model parameters were determined that produce simulations that closely resemble the admixture profiles of 2299 individuals from 84 populations across Island Southeast Asia. The results highlight that greater propensity to migrate and elevated birth rates are related drivers behind the expansion of individuals with Asian ancestry relative to individuals with Papuan ancestry, that offspring preferentially resulted from marriages between Asian women and Papuan men, and that in contrast to current thinking, individuals with Asian ancestry were likely distributed across large parts of western Island Southeast Asia before the Neolithic expansion.

AB Temporary plugging multi-cluster staged fracturing (TPMSF), using multi-cluster perforations and self-degradable diverting agents, is a novel technique to develop oil and gas reservoirs in deep wells. In this paper, the effects of previously created fractures on the initiation and growth of subsequent fracture were numerically investigated by utilizing XFEM-based CZM (i.e., cohesive zone model based on the extended finite element method). A 2D plane-plain model (coupling fluid flow and solid deformation) was established and truss model (truss elements distributed on the previous fracture surfaces) was used to maintain the different width of previously created fracture. Based on the model, multiple fracture simultaneous propagation was firstly simulated and then parametric studies were conducted for different fracture spacing, the propped width of the previous fracture, fracture created sequence, horizontal differential stress, Young's modulus, and rock tensile strength. Numerical results show that multiple fractures cannot propagate uniformly because of fracture interaction even with equal flow rate distributions. During TPMSF, the propped width of the previous fracture, fracture spacing, and Young's modulus primarily control the injection pressure of subsequent fractures; while rock tensile strength has a relatively weaker influence and horizontal stress contrast plays a negligible role. Moreover, the growth of subsequent fractures is dominated by fluid pressure, initial horizontal stresses and induced stresses.

AB The goal of this study was to assess the effect of the intermittent combination of an antiresorptive agent (calcitonin) and an anabolic agent (vitamin D-3) on treating the detrimental effects of Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) on mandibular bone formation and growth. Forty 3-week-old male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: the control group (normal rats), the control C+D group (normal rats injected with calcitonin and vitamin D-3), the diabetic C+D group (diabetic rats injected with calcitonin and vitamin D-3) and the diabetic group (uncontrolled diabetic rats). An experimental DM condition was induced in the male Wistar rats in the diabetic and diabetic C+D groups using a single dose of 60 mg.kg(-1) body weight of streptozotocin. Calcitonin and vitamin D-3 were simultaneously injected in the rats of the control C+D and diabetic C+D groups. All rats were killed after 4 weeks, and the right mandibles were evaluated by micro-computed tomography and histomorphometric analysis. Diabetic rats showed a significant deterioration in bone quality and bone formation (diabetic group). By contrast, with the injection of calcitonin and vitamin D-3, both bone parameters and bone formation significantly improved (diabetic C+D group) (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that these two hormones might potentially improve various bone properties.

AB An agent-based model incorporating biased assimilation is proposed in this paper to investigate opinion dynamics over a connected social network. The opinion of each agent is represented by a sequence of arguments, and it evolves through the interactions between agents. The probability that one agent chooses another to communicate depends on the similarity of their opinions. During every interaction, interacting agents exchange the argument randomly selected from the corresponding arguments sequence. Theoretical analysis reveals that this model results in consensus on either extreme positive opinion or extreme negative opinion, or generates bi-polarization. Numerical simulations are carried out to investigate the dynamics of the model over different networks. Results are obtained in terms of the effect of homophily, biased assimilation and network topology on opinion formation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB For computational agent-based simulation, to become a serious tool for investigating biological systems requires the implications of simulation-derived results to be appreciated in terms of the original system. However, epistemic uncertainty regarding the exact nature of biological systems can complicate the calibration of models and simulations that attempt to capture their structure and behaviour, and can obscure the interpretation of simulation-derived experimental results with respect to the real domain. We present an approach to the calibration of an agent-based model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse proxy for multiple sclerosis (MS), which harnesses interaction between a modeller and domain expert in mitigating uncertainty in the data derived from the real domain. A novel uncertainty analysis technique is presented that, in conjunction with a latin hypercube-based global sensitivity analysis, can indicate the implications of epistemic uncertainty in the real domain. These analyses may be considered in the context of domain-specific knowledge to qualify the certainty placed on the results of in silico experimentation.

AB Cracking of concrete structures during hydration often occurs during construction. This study investigated the expansive property of concrete with an unstrained expansive agent to reduce cracking. Laboratory tests, field measurement, and numerical simulations on deformation during hydration were investigated. The test results of the unstrained specimen indicated that the expansive ratio reached a peak in the first 14 h for the water-binder (w/b) ratios of 0.43 and 0.6. However, when w/b = 0.3, the expansion ratio needed a long time to reach the peak (30 h). The expansion ratio remained unchanged after the peak. The amount of the expansive agent and the water-binder ratio show a significant correlation with the expansive capacity. The relative favorable content of the expansive agent and w/b ratio of concrete with the expansive agent were 10% and 0.43, respectively. A concrete floor with the expansive agent showed an overall compressed state, which indicates that concrete shrinkage was fully compensated by the addition of the expansive agent.

DE agent-based models; COVID-19; epidemiology; vaccination
AB Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, public health authorities and the general population are striving to achieve a balance between safety and normalcy. Ever changing conditions call for the development of theory and simulation tools to finely describe multiple strata of society while supporting the evaluation of "what-if" scenarios. Particularly important is to assess the effectiveness of potential testing approaches and vaccination strategies. Here, an agent-based modeling platform is proposed to simulate the spreading of COVID-19 in small towns and cities, with a single-individual resolution. The platform is validated on real data from New Rochelle, NY-one of the first outbreaks registered in the United States. Supported by expert knowledge and informed by reported data, the model incorporates detailed elements of the spreading within a statistically realistic population. Along with pertinent functionality such as testing, treatment, and vaccination options, the model accounts for the burden of other illnesses with symptoms similar to COVID-19. Unique to the model is the possibility to explore different testing approaches-in hospitals or drive-through facilities-and vaccination strategies that could prioritize vulnerable groups. Decision-making by public authorities could benefit from the model, for its fine-grain resolution, open-source nature, and wide range of features.

AB Funded social security programs are particularly vulnerable to economic and financial market shocks. As a consequence of the recent crisis, a large fraction of the Dutch pension funds had to submit restoration plans for the recovery of their buffers. Such plans will have to rely primarily on a mix of reduced benefit indexation and increased pension contributions. Hence, a discussion has emerged whether indexation should be differentiated across the various groups of participants in a pension fund. We investigate this issue numerically, developing an applied many-generation small open-economy OLG model with heterogeneous agents. The pension system consists of a first-pillar PAYG component and a second pillar with a pension fund. In our stochastic simulations, we hit the economy with a variety of unexpected demographic, economic and financial shocks. We compare uniform indexation of pension rights across all fund participants with alternatives such as status-contingent indexation in which pensions are protected against price inflation. While the aggregate welfare consequences are small, group-specific consequences are more substantial with the workers and future born losing and retirees benefitting from a shift away from uniform indexation. The exception is a scheme which links indexation directly to the fund's asset performance. Under this scheme the retired benefit without other groups losing. The welfare effects are primarily the result of systematic welfare redistributions rather than of shifts in the benefits of risk sharing. Contribution rates always have to rise substantially from their initial levels to maintain the system's sustainability. An increase in the retirement age that leaves existing pension rights untouched does little to avoid this rise with its adverse labour market consequences.

AB Research on collaborative learning has revealed that peer-collaboration explanation activities facilitate reflection and metacognition and that establishing common ground and successful coordination are keys to realizing effective knowledge-sharing in collaborative learning tasks. Studies on computer-supported collaborative learning have investigated how awareness tools can facilitate coordination within a group and how the use of external facilitation scripts can elicit elaborated knowledge during collaboration. However, the separate and joint effects of these tools on the nature of the collaborative process and performance have rarely been investigated. This study investigates how two facilitation methods-coordination support via learner gaze-awareness feedback and metacognitive suggestion provision via a pedagogical conversational agent (PCA)-are able to enhance the learning process and learning gains. Eighty participants, organized into dyads, were enrolled in a 2 x 2 between-subject study. The first and second factors were the presence of real-time gaze feedback (no vs. visible gaze) and that of a suggestion-providing PCA (no vs. visible agent), respectively. Two evaluation methods were used: namely, dialog analysis of the collaborative process and evaluation of learning gains. The real-time gaze feedback and PCA suggestions facilitated the coordination process, while gaze was relatively more effective in improving the learning gains. Learners in the Gaze-feedback condition achieved superior learning gains upon receiving PCA suggestions. A successful coordination/high learning performance correlation was noted solely for learners receiving visible gaze feedback and PCA suggestions simultaneously (visible gaze/visible agent). This finding has the potential to yield improved collaborative processes and learning gains through integration of these two methods as well as contributing towards design principles for collaborative-learning support systems more generally.

AB Cooperation is ubiquitous in our real life but everyone would like to maximize her own profits. How does cooperation occur in the group of self-interested agents without centralized control? Furthermore, in a hostile scenario, for example, cooperation is unlikely to emerge. Is there any mechanism to promote cooperation if populations are given and play rules are not allowed to change? In this paper, numerical experiments show that complete population interaction is unfriendly to cooperation in the finite but end-unknown Repeated Prisoner's Dilemma (RPD). Then a mechanism called soft control is proposed to promote cooperation. According to the basic idea of soft control, a number of special agents are introduced to intervene in the evolution of cooperation. They comply with play rules in the original group so that they are always treated as normal agents. For our purpose, these special agents have their own strategies and share knowledge. The capability of the mechanism is studied under different settings. We find that soft control can promote cooperation and is robust to noise. Meanwhile simulation results demonstrate the applicability of the mechanism in other scenarios. Besides, the analytical proof also illustrates the effectiveness of soft control and validates simulation results. As a way of intervention in collective behaviors, soft control provides a possible direction for the study of reciprocal behaviors.

AB In order to mitigate the unsuccessful subscription of crowdfunding projects, it is critical for the fundraisers to understand various factors and dynamic behaviours affecting the adoption of crowdfunding projects. This study aims to forecast the adoption rate by understanding the underlying preferences of individual customers which is adjusted to their perceived risk and social forces influencing their adoption. To evaluate strategies that could potentially increase crowdfunding adoption, the study illustrates a detailed implementation of the proposed data-driven agent-based model, designed using AnyLogic 8.2 and parameterised using Conjoint Analysis implemented in SPSS 17. The proposed model is applied to a crowdfunding market in an Indian context and encapsulates the output statistics under various scenarios. The results indicate that disclosing the risk information about the crowdfunding project is the most important factor in making the campaign successful. Sensitivity analysis shows that investor's risk aversion towards crowdfunding accelerates their adoption rate of crowdfunding. The study provides an insight for the crowdfunders in making pre-launch preparations to build a crowdfunding campaign that influences a network of target audience. This study presents a unique, intuitive simulation-based approach, integrating the concepts of an extended Bass Diffusion Model and the Conjoint Model from an agent-based perspective.

AB We introduce the papers appearing in the special issue of this journal associated with the WEHIA 2015. The papers in issue deal with two growing fields in the in the literature inspired by the complexity-based approach to economic analysis. The first group of contributions develops network models of financial systems and show how these models can shed light on relevant issues that emerged in the aftermath of the last financial crisis. The second group of contributions deals with the issue of validation of agent-based model. Agent-based models have proven extremely useful to account for key features economic dynamics that are usually neglected by more standard models. At the same time, agent-based models have been criticized for the lack of an adequate validation against empirical data. The works in this issue propose useful techniques to validate agent-based models, thus contributing to the wider diffusion of these models in the economic discipline.

AB Experimental studies in the therapy of malignant abdominal tumors have shown that different cytotoxic agents suppress the intraperitoneal tumor growth. Nevertheless, a general accepted approach to prevent tumor recurrences does not exist. Following subcutaneous and intraperitoneal injection of 104 colon adenocarcinoma cells (DHD/K12/TRb), the influences of both taurolidine or taurolidine/heparin on intraperitoneal and subcutaneous tumor growth was investigated in 105 rats undergoing midline laparotomy. The animals were randomized into 7 groups and operated on during 30 min. To investigate the intraperitoneal ( local) influence of either taurolidine or heparin on tumor growth, the substances were applied intraperitoneally. Systemic and intraperitoneal effects were evaluated after intravenous injection of the substances. Both application forms were also combined to analyze synergistic effects. Tumor weights, as well as the incidence of abdominal wound metastases, were determined four weeks after the intervention. In order to evaluate the effects of the agents, blood was taken to determine the peripheral leukocytes counts. Intraperitoneal tumor growth in rats receiving intraperitoneal application of taurolidine ( median 7.0 mg, P = 0.05) and of taurolidine/heparin ( median 0 mg, P = 0.02) was significantly reduced when compared to the control group ( median 185 mg). The simultaneous instillation of both agents also reduced the intraperitoneal tumor growth ( median 4 mg, P = 0.04), while the intravenous injection of the substances caused no local effect. In contrast, the subcutaneous tumor growth did not differ among all groups. In all groups, abdominal wound recurrences were rare and did not differ. Independent of the agents and the application form, the operation itself caused a slight leukopenia shortly after the operation and a leukocytosis in the following course. Intraperitoneal therapy of either taurolidine or in combination with heparin inhibits local tumor growth and abdominal wound recurrences in rats undergoing midline laparotomy. Neither the intraperitoneal nor the intravenous application or the combination of the two agents influenced the subcutaneous tumor growth. The substances did not alter the changes of peripheral leukocytes.

AB In this paper an agent-based model is proposed in which effects of collective cognition are represented via the operazionalization of the construct of collective memory. The model is aimed at representing an evolving local networks of suppliers and final firms competing among them, making alliances and selling products on the market in the presence of environmental instability. A set of hypothesis has been tested in order to evaluate the influence on network's performances of collective memory.
   Through the proposed model, this article illustrates advantages and limitations of computer based models to investigate collective cognition. The extent to which computational approaches can be used to model collective cognitive constructs such as collective memory and learning and their influence on social action is examined. Finally, implications for research and practice on organizational cognition resulting from a social computation view are outlined.

AB The 1-hexadecyl-3-vinylimidazolium bromide (hvimBr), a water-soluble long-chain imidazolium ionic liquid (IL) with surfactant properties, showed the ability to produce stable homogeneous aqueous dispersions of pristine Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (SWNTs). The purpose of this study is the improvement of SWNT dispersing ability by assessing the effect of different groups in position 3 of the imidazole ring. In this regard structural analogues were synthesized and, after characterization, their capability to dissolve SWNTs in water was investigated. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations have been performed to provide a semi-quantitative indication of the affinity of each dispersing agent toward SWNT and to attempt an explanation of the experimental results.

AB Consumers frequently consume hedonic products together with other consumers and derive value from this shared experience. This article investigates the impact of shared consumption, a type of social influence that determines the enjoyment of joint experiences, in the context of a typical hedonic product: movies. The authors argue that this type of influence has important consequences for the diffusion curves of hedonic goods that are consumed together and the effectiveness of advertising in generating launch and postlaunch sales. An empirically validated agent-based model simulates the U.S. motion picture market, with new movies launching, competing, and exiting. The agent-based model serves as a means to demonstrate the essential role of shared consumption for explaining movie life cycles and tests how advertising expenditures accelerate and/or acquire movies' demand in markets with varying levels of shared consumption. The results provide key theoretical insights for the new product diffusion of hedonic products and help managers predict the financial consequences of their strategic decisions.

ID MODEL
AB This paper presents an operational prototype-of an innovative framework for the transit assignment problem, structured in a multiagent way and inspired by a learning-based approach. The proposed framework is based on representing passengers and their learning and decisionmaking activities explicitly. The underlying hypothesis is that individual passengers are expected to adjust their behavior (i.e., trip choices) according to their experience with transit system performance. A hypothetical transit network, which consists of 22 routes and 194 stops, has been developed within a microsimulation platform (Paramics). A population of 3,000 passengers was generated and synthesized to model the transit assignment process in the morning peak period. Using reinforcement learning to represent passengers' adaptation and accounting for differences in passengers' preferences and the dynamics of the transit network, the prototype has demonstrated that the proposed approach can simultaneously predict how passengers will choose their routes and estimate the total passenger travel cost in a congested network as well as loads on different transit routes.

AB Distributed group cooperative guidance (DGCG) problems for multiple missiles with fixed and switching directed communication topologies are dealt with. In contrast to traditional cooperative guidance utilized to intercept one single target, the group cooperative guidance is applicable to multiple targets. In the group cooperative attack, multi-missile system is classified into multiple subgroups, and each subgroup attacks its respective target. Missiles in the same subgroup are required to reach the target simultaneously, while different subgroups may cooperate successively in terms of the impact time. To realize the group cooperative attack, a two-step guidance strategy is developed. The first step adopts a DGCG law based on local neighboring information for multiple missiles to realize group consensus on range-to-go and leading angle. The second step begins when the group consensus of missiles is achieved. During this step, each missile attacks the target under the proportional navigation guidance law. Derived from feedback linearization and convergence analysis, sufficient conditions for multiple missiles to realize the group cooperative attack with fixed and switching directed communication topologies are proposed, respectively. Finally, numerical examples with two subgroups are given to show the effectiveness of the two-step guidance strategy.

AB The distributed event-triggered optimization problem for multiple nonholonomic robots has been studied to minimize the global battery energy consumption. Each robot possesses its own cost function which depends on the state of the hand position and represents battery energy consumption. By coordinate transformation, the dynamics of the hand positions can be formulated into two groups of first-order integrators. Then the distributed event-triggered optimization algorithm is designed such that the states of robots' hand positions exponentially converge to the optimizer of the global cost function. Meanwhile, the velocity and orientation of each robot are ensured to reach zero and a certain constant, respectively. Moreover, the inter-execution time is lower bounded and the Zeno behavior is therefore naturally avoided. Numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB The definition of the porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) is presented and compared with diseases caused by a single etiological viral or bacterial agent. The classification of viruses or bacteria participating in the multifactorial etiology of disease complexes, among them PRDC, include microorganisms initiating the pathological process, as well as a second group of microorganisms, following after the primary destruction of the resistance to infection, that joins in the pathogenesis of the pathological complex. Another grouping takes into account the higher and lower importance of the etiological agents in causing disease and losses in animal production. The role of the following microorganisms participating in the etiology of PRDC is defined as follows: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, Swine influenza virus, Aujeszky disease virus, Porcine circovirus type 2, Porcine respiratory corona virus, Porcine cytomegalovirus, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus parasuis, Streptococcus suis, Actinobacillus suis, Arcanobacterium pyogenes and Salmonella spp. Data on simultaneous bacterial-bacterial interactions, viral-viral interactions, and bacterial-viral interactions are discussed.

ID SIMULATION
AB Ridesharing with social contacts (i.e., 'friends') is substantially more accepted than with strangers. However, limiting ridesharing to friends while rejecting strangers also reduces ride choices and increases detour costs. This work studies, from a theoretical perspective, whether the additional detour costs of limiting shared rides to social network contacts would be prohibitive. It proposes a social network based ridesharing algorithm with heterogeneous detour tolerances for varied social contacts. The theoretical matching rates and detour costs are compared in a simulation for three levels of social connectivity: travelling with direct contacts only, with direct and indirect contacts, or with anyone. The simulation allows for a systematic and comprehensive testing of system behaviour when varying the parameters of social network structure, detour tolerance, and spatial distribution of friendship. Results show that for a clustered friendship - the expected spatial distribution of a social network growing with a ridesharing network - ridesharing with friends does not cause significantly higher costs. Furthermore, the algorithm prioritising friends can substantially increase the matching of friends. An empirical study justifies the findings. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Agent-based modeling is a promising method to investigate market dynamics, as it allows modeling the behavior of all market participants individually. Integrating empirical data in the agents' decision model can improve the validity of agent-based models (ABMs). We present an approach of using discrete choice experiments (DCEs) to enhance the empirical foundation of ABMs. The DCE method is based on random utility theory and therefore has the potential to enhance the ABM approach with a well-established economic theory. Our combined approach is applied to a case study of a roundwood market in Switzerland. We conducted DCEs with roundwood suppliers to quantitatively characterize the agents' decision model. We evaluate our approach using a fitness measure and compare two DCE evaluation methods, latent class analysis and hierarchical Bayes. Additionally, we analyze the influence of the error term of the utility function on the simulation results and present a way to estimate its probability distribution.

AB The importance of sustainable operations in supply chains has been widely recognised in practice and the extant literature. In this paper, we study coordination issues of a sustainable supply chain that arise due to simultaneous consideration of greening and corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives undertaken by supply chain agents. We specifically consider the scenario where the supplier is responsible for greening and the buyer is accountable for social responsibility. We analyse our model using two-stage Stackelberg game-theoretic approach where the supplier acts as a Stackelberg leader. In this context, we analyse the decentralised supply chain setting using five different contract types, namely wholesale price, linear two-part tariff (LTT), greening-cost sharing, revenue sharing, and revenue and greening-cost sharing contracts (RGCS). We demonstrate how optimal greening level, CSR level, retail price and profits of supply chain agents are influenced by different contract types. Our analytical results show that greening and social efforts undertaken by supply chain agents are beneficial for the overall supply chain as long as consumer awareness towards greening and CSR exists. Our results show that channel coordinating mechanisms between supplier and buyer is conducive to improve greening and CSR level. LTT perfectly coordinates the supply chain. Through a numerical example with several key parameters we present the effectiveness of different contracts. The results reveal that as a profit maximising agent the supplier prefers LTT contract and the buyer prefers RGCS contract. This paper extends the understanding of supply chain coordination in the context of sustainability. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The effect of social interactions on how opinions are developed and changed over time is crucial to public processes that involve citizens and their points of view. In this opinion dynamics exercise, we address the topic of nuclear waste repositories in Switzerland and suggest a more realistic investigation of public opinion using agent-based modeling in combination with empirical data and sociopsychological theory. Empirical dataobtained froman online questionnaire (N = 841) is used for the initialization of the model, whoseagents directly represent the participants. We use social judgment theory (SJT) to describe how opinions can be adapted during social interactions, including through mechanisms of contrast and assimilation. Furthermore, we focus on the definition of "opinion" itself, claiming that working with disaggregated opinions (i.e., arguments) can play a determining role if one aims to capture real-world mechanisms of opinion dynamics. Simulation results show different patterns for the three different argument categories used for this specific topic (i.e., risk, benefit, and process), suggesting a mutual influence between an individual's initial knowledge and evaluations and an individual's social dynamics and opinion changes. The importance of content-related and empirical information, as well as the theory and mechanisms used in the social simulation, are discussed.

AB The therapeutic efficacy of drugs, especially hydrophobic anticancer agents, can be dramatically improved using advanced nanoplatforms. Recently, there has been a growing interest in themodification of nanoparticleswith polymers and chemical functional groups to improve their pharmacokinetic properties, decrease toxicity, and enhance targeted delivery of loaded drugs. Molecular dynamic simulation is a novel computational method for obtaining information about the formation, behavior, and structural changes of nanoparticles under different conditions. Despite some limitations in theoretical methods, simulation of nano drug delivery systems has been effective in experimental findings and interpretation of the resultant data could be of great help to predict the desiredmaterial for experimental conditions.

AB Although the environment in which termites live is very heterogeneous, most experimental studies on the termite tunnel patterns have been conducted on homogeneous sand substrates. In order to explore how the heterogeneity affects tunnel patterns, I developed an agent-based model to simulate termite tunneling behavior at the individual level. In this model, grid space consists of easy and difficult areas for tunneling. Heterogeneity, H, was defined as the degree of the mixture of the two areas. The tunnel patterns formed by changing the number of termites, N, and H were quantitatively characterized by territory circularity and the territory area. These patterns were categorized into two groups, one with a small territory area and high circularity (group 1) and the other with a large area and low circularity (group 2). Considering the previous study that the termite populations with high N values have high territorial scalability, it can be said that the territories belonging to group 2 have higher foraging abilities and viability than those belonging to group 1. The simulation results showed that the tunnel patterns generated for small N and high H belonged to group 2. This implies that the heterogeneity can make a positive contribution to the expansion of the foraging area by effectively focusing the foraging energy of a termite population. I briefly discussed the mechanism of this positive role and the limitations of this simulation study. In addition, I discussed issues that need to be resolved in the near future to overcome the limitations.

Based on over 200 published studies, this ABM describes interactions among 21 cells or cytokines and incorporates 226 experimental data sets and/or data estimates from those reports to simulate a mouse HIR in silico. Our simulated results reproduced dynamic patterns of HIR reported in the literature. As shown in vivo, our model also demonstrated that sepsis was highly related to the initial Salmonella dose and the presence of components of the adaptive immune system. We determined that high mobility group box-1, C-reactive protein, and the interleukin-10: tumor necrosis factor-a ratio, and CD4+ T cell: CD8+ T cell ratio, all recognized as biomarkers during HIR, significantly correlated with outcomes of HIR. During therapy-directed silico simulations, our results demonstrated that anti-agent intervention impacted the survival rates of septic individuals in a time-dependent manner. By specifying the infected species, source of infection, and site of infection, this ABM enabled us to reproduce the kinetics of several essential indicators during a HIR, observe distinct dynamic patterns that are manifested during HIR, and allowed us to test proposed therapy-directed treatments. Although limitation still exists, this ABM is a step forward because it links underlying biological processes to computational simulation and was validated through a series of comparisons between the simulated results and experimental studies.

AB Policymaking implies planning, and planning requires prediction-or at least some knowledge about the future. This contribution starts from the challenges of complexity, uncertainty, and agency, which refute the prediction of social systems, especially where new knowledge (scientific discoveries, emergent technologies, and disruptive innovations) is involved as a radical game-changer. It is important to be aware of the fundamental critiques, approaches, and fields such as Technology Assessment, the Forrester World Models, Economic Growth Theory, or the Linear Model of Innovation have received in the past decades. It is likewise important to appreciate the limitations and consequences these diagnoses pose on science, technology and innovation policy (STI policy). However, agent-based modeling and simulation now provide new options to address the challenges of planning and prediction in social systems. This paper will discuss these options for STI policy with a particular emphasis on the contribution of the social sciences both in offering theoretical grounding and in providing empirical data. Fields such as Science and Technology Studies, Innovation Economics, Sociology of Knowledge/Science/Technology etc. inform agent-based simulation models in a way that realistic representations of STI policy worlds can be brought to the computer. These computational STI worlds allow scenario analysis, experimentation, policy modeling and testing prior to any policy implementations in the real world. This contribution will illustrate this for the area of STI policy using examples from the SKIN model. Agent-based simulation can help us to shed light into the darkness of the future-not in predicting it, but in coping with the challenges of complexity, in understanding the dynamics of the system under investigation, and in finding potential access points for planning of its future offering "weak prediction".

AB In the last decade, the uptake of agent-based modeling in demography and other population sciences has been slowly increasing. Still, in such areas, where traditional data-driven, statistical approaches prevail, the hypothesis-driven design of agent-based models leads to questioning the validity of these models. Consequently, suitable means to increase the confidence into models and simulation results are required. To that end, explicit, replicable simulation experiments play a central role in model design and validation. However, the analysis of more complex models implies executing various experiments, each of which combines various methods. To streamline these experimentation processes a flexible computational simulation environment is necessary. With a new binding between SESSL-an internal domain-specific language for simulation experiments - and ML3 - a simulator for linked lives designed specifically for agent-based demographic models - we cater for these objectives and provide a powerful simulation tool. The proposed approach can serve as a foundation for current efforts of employing advanced and statistical model analysis of agent-based demographic models, as part of a wider process of iterative model building. We demonstrate its potential in specifying and executing different experiments with a simple model of return migration and a more complex model of social care.

   implications for agent-based modeling
SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-PLANNING & DESIGN

AB Powerful computational tools are becoming available to represent the behavior of complex systems. Agent-based modeling, in particular, facilitates an examination of the system-level outcomes of the heterogeneous actions of a set of heterogeneous agents: for example, patterns of land-use and land-cover change, such as urban sprawl as a result of residential location decisions. These new tools create new demands for data, and empirical studies of the selection behavior of residents. Using resident responses from the 2001 Detroit Area Study survey, we compared two alternative approaches to characterizing the heterogeneous preferences of agents; both based on a factor analysis of resident responses to questions about their reasons for moving to their current location. We used cluster analysis to identify how many and what types of residents there are, grouped by similar preferences. We also evaluated the relationships between socioeconomic and demographic characteristics and location preferences using regression trees, and evaluated the fit of the relationship to determine the degree to which socioeconomic characteristics predict preferences. The results showed that the preferences of resident exurbans of single-family homes in the Detroit metropolitan area were heterogeneous and that distinct preference groups do exist in resident populations, but are not well characterized on the basis of simple socioeconomic and demographic variables. We conclude that, given the heterogeneous nature of preferences and a relatively limited number of preference groupings observed in the survey respondents, agent-based models simulating resident behavior should reflect this diversity in the population and incorporate distinct agent classes of empirically derived preference distributions.

AB An agent-based model of firms and their stakeholders' economic actions was used to test the theoretical feasibility of sustainable corporate social responsibility activities. Corporate social responsibility has become important to many firms, but CSR activities tend to get less attention during busts than during boom times. The hypothesis tested is that the CSR activities of a firm are more economically rational if the economic actions of its stakeholders reflect the firm's level of CSR. Our model focuses on three types of stakeholders: workers, consumers, and shareholders. First, we construct a uniform framework based on a microeconomic foundation that includes these stakeholders and the corresponding firms. Then, we formulate parameters for CSR in this framework. Our aim is to identify the conditions under which every type of stakeholder derives benefits from a firm's CSR activities. We simulated our model with heterogeneous agents by computer using several scenarios. For each one, the simulation was run 100 times with different random seeds. We first simulated the homogeneous version discussed above to verify the concept of our model. Next, we simulated the case in which workers had heterogeneous abilities, the firms had cost for CSR activities, and the workers, consumers, and shareholders had zero CSR awareness. We tested the robustness of our simulation results by using sensitivity analysis. Specifically, we investigated the conditions for the pecuniary advantage of CSR activities and effects offsetting benefits of CSR activities. Finally, we developed a new model installed bounded rational and simulated. The results show that the economic actions of stakeholders during boom periods greatly affect the sustainability of CSR activities during slow periods. This insight should lead to a feasible and effective prescription for sustainable CSR activities.

TI Towards Exploration of Social in Social Internet of Vehicles Using an

DT Article
AB Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is turning out to be one of the first impressive examples of Internet of Things (IoT). In IoV, the factors of connectivity and interaction/information dispersion are equally important as sensing/actuating, context-awareness, services provisioning, etc. However, most of the researches related to connectivity and interaction are constrained to physics of signaling and data science (semantics/contents), respectively. Very rapidly, the meanings of these factors are changing due to evolution of technologies from physical to social domain. For example, Social IoV (SIoV) is a term used to represent when vehicles build and manage their own social network. Hence, in addition to physical aspects, the social aspects of connectivity and information dispersion towards these systems of future should also be researched, a domain so far ignored in this particular context. In this paper, an agent-based model of information sharing (for context-based recommendations) of a hypothetical population of smart vehicles is presented. Some important hypotheses are tested under reasonable connectivity and data constraints. The simulation results reveal that closure of social ties and its timing impacts the dispersion of novel information (necessary for a recommender system) substantially. It is also observed that as the network evolves due to incremental interactions, the recommendations guaranteeing a fair distribution of vehicles across equally good competitors is not possible.

AB The epoxy resin diglycidyl ether of Bisphenol A (BADGE n = 0) has been cured with a new synthesized hardener (2-adamantylethanamine) and the crosslinking reaction was characterized by DSC. Values of 413.3 J/g and 95 degrees C have been obtained for the enthalpy of the reaction and the glass transition temperature, respectively. The experimental results obey Kamal's model over all conversion range of temperatures (70 degrees C-100 degrees C). The activation energies of the mechanisms involved in the curing reaction have been determined for both the autocatalytic and then-order mechanism, the values being 63.3 and 29.8 kJ/mol, respectively. The value forT(g)is 23 degrees C higher than the one for (BADGE n = 0)/amantadine, while the activation energy for then-order mechanism is around 13 kJ/mol lower. This is consistent with a higher steric effect of the adamantyl group in the second hardener since it will hinder the opening the oxirane ring by the nitrogen atom of the amino group. As the polymerization reaction progress, this effect will disappear as the distance adamantyl-oxirane increase when new oxirane groups react with the hydroxyl groups (autocatalyzed reaction). Consequently, by selecting the appropriate cross-linking agent, it is possible to simultaneously increaseT(g)while reducing theactivation energy, two effects which may be desirable for some industrial applications of the material.

AB An asset pricing model with chartists, fundamentalists and trend followers is considered. A market maker adjusts the asset price in the direction of the excess demand at the end of each trading session. An exogenously given fundamental price discriminates between a bull market and a bear market. The buying and selling orders of traders change moving from a bull market to a bear market. Their asymmetric propensity to trade leads to a discontinuity in the model, with its deterministic skeleton given by a two-dimensional piecewise linear dynamical system in discrete time. Multiple attractors, such as a stable fixed point and one or more attracting cycles or cycles and chaotic attractors, appear through border collision bifurcations. The multi-stability regions are underlined by means of two-dimensional bifurcation diagrams, where the border collision bifurcation curves are detected in analytic form at least for basic cycles with symbolic sequences LRn and RLn. A statistical analysis of the simulated time series of the asset returns, generated by perturbing the deterministic dynamics with a random walk process, indicates that this is one of the simplest asset pricing models which are able to replicate stylized empirical facts, such as excess volatility, fat tails and volatility clustering.

AB The effect of silica/gold nanoshells and titanium dioxide nanoparticles on the optical properties of skin is studied. By implementing in vivo measurements and Monte Carlo simulations, we analyze the efficiency of using these nanoparticles as contrasting agents for optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging of skin. In vivo measurements are performed on pig skin, where nanoparticle suspension drops have been applied. The identification of skin layers is performed by comparison with corresponding histology images. Experimental results exhibit an increase in contrast of the obtained OCT images after a single nanoparticles application. Multiple applications do not lead to increase in the obtained contrast. To interpret the obtained experimental OCT images of skin and understand the mechanisms of contrasting, a set of Monte Carlo calculations is performed. The results of the simulations exhibit good qualitative agreement with the experimental images, and prove that the contrasting originates from the nanoparticles added, while the contrast of inclusion originates from the absence of nanoparticles within it and their presence in the surrounding area.

AB The concept of Tradable Mobility Credit scheme (TMC) has been explored as an innovative Active Traffic and Demand Management (ATDM) strategy using economic instruments. In a general TMC scheme, a Central Authority Agency (CAA) issues a certain amount of mobility credits to eligible travelers. Credits are charged if the travelers take specific routes while the credits can also be traded in between of travelers in a market. An online interactive experiment, within which human participants extensively interact with each other and with intelligent virtual agents in credit trading and route choice stages, is conducted in this study. Hypothesized behavioral effects that characterize responses to TMC in personal car use domain, including loss aversion, immediacy effect and learning effect, are observed. Next, simulated experiments under various credit demand/supply situations, with only virtual agents, are conducted. The results show the proposed TMC scheme is fairly efficient and financially sustainable. Fast market equilibrium convergence is observed as well. The future TMC scheme design could accommodate the insights from this empirical study. In the meantime, the experiment platform could serve as a handy data collection tool that could be portable for any future studies involving online interactions and collective choices in transportation realm.

AB This study explores the adverse effects of customer disappointment after adoption accompanied by spreading negative word-of-mouth on firm profits. The study examines the effects of heterogeneity and assortativity of customer revenue on the profit impact of negative word-of-mouth that is initiated by three groups of consumers-revenue leaders, social hubs, and experts. The authors explore these effects using an agent-based simulation modeling approach and an in-depth computational experiment with empirical input data regarding social connectivity from 10 consumer social networks. The results indicate that negative word-of-mouth is more damaging in markets where there is a higher degree of heterogeneity. Moreover, assortativity may significantly affect the profit impact of disappointments, but this effect depends on the initial percentage of disappointed adopters. The study also finds an interaction between heterogeneity and assortativity, such that the effect of heterogeneity increases as assortativity increases up to a moderate level of assortativity, then the effect of heterogeneity on profits remains relatively constant. The implications from these results suggest that marketing managers should consider the heterogeneity and assortativity characteristics of their customer revenue streams to (a) better manage the adverse profit impacts of customer disappointments and negative word-of-mouth; (b) design more effective customer loyalty programs; and (c) more efficiently manage their customer equity portfolios.

AB Ultrasound microbubble contrast agents have been demonstrated to scatter subharmonic energy at one-half the driving frequency. At ultrasound frequencies in the 20-40 MHz range, the subharmonic offers the potential to differentiate the blood in the microcirculation from the surrounding tissue. It is unknown whether current contrast agents, manufactured to be resonant between 2 and 12 MHz, are ideal for subharmonic imaging at higher frequencies. We performed numerical simulations of the Keller-Miksis model for the behavior of a single bubble and experimental investigations of Definity microbubbles in water. The results supported the hypothesis that off-resonant bubbles, excited at their second harmonic, may be primarily responsible for the observed subharmonic energy. For frequencies between 20 and 32 MHz and 32 and 40 MHz, the optimal bubble diameters for the generation of subharmonics in vitro were determined experimentally to be 1.2-5 mu m and less than 1.2 mu m, respectively. Definity may be a suitable ultrasound contrast agent for subharmonic imaging at 20 MHz with peak-negative pressures between 380 and 590 kPa and pulses greater than or equal to four cycles in duration.

ID DISCOVERY
AB The constructionist framework for analyzing social problems rests upon the concept of "claimsmakers" who engage in definitional activities. Published researches often approach claimsmakers as agents who speak social problems into existence by naming and typifying putative conditions. This established usage fails to consider several important issues. First, claimsmakers are not merely detached interpreters but are themselves implicated in conditions. Claimsmakers, moreover, are not only speakers who deliver social-problem monologues but are also audiences that engage in dialogue with other claimsmakers. Furthermore, claimsmakers are not only the authors of social problems discourse, but are also its objects in two senses. First, they appear as positive or negative typifications in their own discourse and that of others. Second, claimsmakers sometimes emerge as special symbols that are subsequently available as resources for future social-problems discourse. These considerations indicate that the constructionist framework and empirical researches may be improved through recognition of the dialectic of claimsmakers as both speakers and audiences, both agents and objects - indeed as functioning simultaneously in all these capacities. Ultimately, claimsmakers' influence may result from having been transformed into generalizable symbols. Their agency, paradoxically, may succeed because of their objectification.

AB In this work, we combine a generic alloy-by-design model with a novel concept, the nucleation barrier for the formation of Laves phase to fill the creep cavities, in order to develop multi-component creep resistant steels with kinetically tuned self-healing behaviour. In the model the high-temperature long-term strength is estimated by integrating precipitation strengthening due to M23C6 carbides and solid solution strengthening, while the optimized compositional solutions are determined by employing the coupled thermodynamic and kinetic principles. W-containing Laves phase herein is selected as the self-healing agent to autonomously fill the grain boundary cavities, so as to prolong the creep lifetime. To achieve the effective healing reaction, the nucleation time for Laves precipitates are expected to coincide simultaneously with which creep cavities start to form or reach a healable size. Using experimental data from literature, an empirical relationship to estimate the incubation time for Laves phase formation has been constructed, from which the thermodynamic driving force for onset of precipitation as a function of temperature and intended precipitate nucleation time was derived. Three sample alloys have been selected among the desirable solutions, which are predicted to have the same strength but widely different Laves phase nucleation times. The calculations are also performed for different use temperatures to explore the compatibility between high temperature strength and timely cavity filling behaviour. In its current form the model is not expected to yield the truly optimal composition but to demonstrate how the kinetics of the healing reaction can affect the predicted optimal alloy compositions.

AB We study the model of interacting agents proposed by Chakraborti and Chakrabarti [Eur. Phys. J. B 17 (2000) 167] that allows agents to both save and exchange wealth. Closed equations for the wealth distribution are developed using a mean field approximation. We show that when all agents have the same fixed savings propensity, subject to certain well-defined approximations defined in the text, these equations yield the conjecture proposed by Chakraborti and Chakrabarti [Eur. Phys. J. B 17 (2000) 167] for the form of the stationary agent wealth distribution.
   If the savings propensity for the equations is chosen according to some random distribution, we show further that the wealth distribution for large values of wealth displays a Pareto-like power-law tail, i.e., P(w)similar to w(1+a). However, the value of a for the model is exactly 1. Exact numerical simulations for the model illustrate how, as the savings distribution function narrows to zero, the wealth distribution changes from a Pareto form to an exponential function. Intermediate regions of wealth may be approximately described by a power law with a > 1. However, the value never reaches values of similar to 1.6-1.7 that characterise empirical wealth data. This conclusion is not changed if three-body agent exchange processes are allowed. We conclude that other mechanisms are required if the model is to agree with empirical wealth data.

AB Stock markets are very important in modern societies and their behavior has serious implications for a wide spectrum of the world's population. Investors, governing bodies, and society as a whole could benefit from better understanding of the behavior of stock markets. The traditional approach to analyzing such systems is the use of analytical models. However, the complexity of financial markets represents a big challenge to the analytical approach. Most analytical models make simplifying assumptions, such as perfect rationality and homogeneous investors, which threaten the validity of their results. This motivates alternative methods.
   In this paper, we report an artificial financial market and its use in studying the behavior of stock markets. This is an endogenous market, with which we model technical, fundamental, and noise traders. Nevertheless, our primary focus is on the technical traders, which are sophisticated genetic programming based agents that co-evolve (by learning based on their fitness function) by predicting investment opportunities in the market using technical analysis as the main tool.
   With this endogenous artificial market, we identify the conditions under which the statistical properties of price series in the artificial market resemble some of the properties of real financial markets. By performing a careful exploration of the most important aspects of our simulation model, we determine the way in which the factors of such a model affect the endogenously generated price. Additionally, we model the pressure to beat the market by a behavioral constraint imposed on the agents reflecting the Red Queen principle in evolution. We have demonstrated how evolutionary computation could play a key role in studying stock markets, mainly as a suitable model for economic learning on an agent-based simulation.

AB Purpose: To evaluate in the laboratory the effect of an 8.0% arginine and calcium carbonate desensitizing paste in occluding open dentin tubules and examine the effect of bonding between the adhesive agents and dentin after being treated with the desensitizing paste. Methods: Two self-etching adhesives were used. Intact human premolars extracted for orthodontic reasons were used within 3 months of extraction. The occlusal enamel was removed and dentin slices were polished. The dentin tubules were opened by etching with a 1% citric acid solution for 20 seconds to simulate a postoperative sensitivity model. Then the specimens were randomly assigned into five groups. Group A: specimens without any treatment (control). Group B: specimens were polished with a slurry (SiO2) for 30 seconds. Groups C, D and E: 8.0% arginine and calcium carbonate desensitizing paste was applied. Specimens in Group C were polished for 3 seconds, and then repeated for another 3 seconds for a total of 6 seconds, according to the manufacturer's instructions: specimens in Group D were polished twice for 9 seconds for a total of 18 seconds; and specimens in Group E were treated for an extended time of 30 seconds. Each group was randomly divided into two sub-groups in order to evaluate the effect on two different adhesive agents. A one-step self-etching adhesive agent (G-Bond) and a two-step self-etching adhesive agent (F1-Bond II) were applied following the manufacturers' instructions. Then microtensile bond strengths of the 10 groups were tested. SEM was used to evaluate the laboratory effect of the desensitizing paste in occluding open dentin tubules. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS version 16.0. Results: The SEM observations showed that the 8.0% arginine and calcium carbonate desensitizing paste could occlude the dentin tubules effectively, and thus may have potential benefits in preventing postoperative sensitivity based on the hydrodynamic theory. An extended application time of 18 or 30 seconds showed no adverse effect of the desensitizing paste on the bonding performance to dentin when using self-etching adhesives containing functional monomers such as 4-MET like G-Bond.

ID MU-M; ABSORPTION; EXTINCTION
AB We present newly measured results of an ongoing experimental program established to measure optical cross sections in the mid- and long-wave infrared for a variety of chemically and biologically based aerosols. For this study we consider only chemically derived aerosols, and in particular, a group of chemical compounds often used as simulants for the detection of extremely toxic organophosphorus nerve agents. These materials include: diethyl methylphosphonate (DEMP), dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP), diisopropyl methylphosphonate (DIMP), and diethyl phthalate (DEP). As reported in a prior study [Appl. Opt. 44, 4001 (2005)], we combine two optical techniques well suited for aerosol spectroscopy [i.e., flow-through photoacoustics and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) emission spectroscopy], to measure in situ the absolute extinction and absorption cross sections over a variety of wavelengths spanning the IR spectral region from 3 to 13 mu m. Aerosol size distribution(s), particle number density, and dosimetric measurements are recorded simultaneously in order to present optical cross sections that are aerosol mass normalized, i.e., m(2)/gram. Photoacoustic results, conducted at a series of CO2 laser lines, compare well with measured broadband FTIR spectral extinction. Both FTIR and photoacoustic data also compare well with Mie theory calculations based on measured size distributions and previously published complex indices of refraction.

AB For determination the inducing factors of arrested development of 3th stage larvae of Haemonchus contortus as early L4 in sheep in 2 out of 4 climatic conditions of Iran, 24, six month old native sheep (shall breed) were randomly allocated into 3 equal groups I, II and III. Each sheep in each group received 10000 local isolate of H.contortus larvae not known to exhibit hypobiosis as follow: (i)Freshly collected larvae were given to group I, (control group).(ii)Larvae stored at 8- 10(oc) and 70% humidity for six weeks (simulating autumn climatic conditions of zone I) to group II.(iii)-larvae exposed to 30-350(oc) and 40% humidity for six weeks (simulating autumn climatic conditions of zone III) to group III. Two lambs in each group at 12, 21, 35 and 60 days post infection were necropsies and the number of adult and larvae were counted. Our findings suggest that the rate of arrested larvae in group II were statistically significant (p<0.01), whereas in two other groups only a very small number of larvae were subjected to hypobiosis. Meanwhile the number of adult worms recovered from group I receiving fresh larvae was higher than the other two groups.

DE Agent-based artificial market; Oligopoly; Particle swarm optimization
ID GENETIC ALGORITHM; MARKET; COLLUSION
AB An agent-based model is used to determine market equilibrium with price-setting firms in an oligopoly market. The agent-based model is designed to match the experimental rules that Brandts and Guillen (J Ind Econ 55:453-474, 2007) used with human subjects. Their model uses posted prices and advance production of a perishable good. When the marginal cost is zero, the analytical Bertrand solution is almost perfect competition. When the marginal cost is nonzero, the game does not have a theoretical equilibrium in pure strategies. The agent-based model results show that with one or two firms, prices are at or near the monopoly level, which matches the human experiments. With four firms, prices are always at the perfectly competitive level when particle swarm optimization is used. Results using a genetic algorithm, however, are noisier than those using the particle swarm optimization, and the genetic algorithm falls short of the competitive solution. The triopoly market changes from mostly monopoly to a price in between monopoly and perfect competition when a marginal cost is added. The computerized agents tend to overproduce so that profits are negative in the three- and four-firm cases when production is costly. While the prices in the simulation are close to those observed in experiments with human subjects, the inefficiency due to overproduction is much greater in the agent-based model results. This result suggests that human agents are able to reach solutions, perhaps through social norms, that are missed by the simple agent-based rules used here.

AB Laboratory-based experimental studies with human participants are beneficial for testing hypotheses in behavioural operational research. However, such experiments are not without their problems. One specific problem is obtaining a sufficient sample size, not only in terms of the number of participants but also the time they are willing to devote to an experiment. In this paper, we explore how agent-based simulation (ABS) can be used to address the sample size problem and demonstrate the approach in the newsvendor setting. The decisionmaking strategies of a small sample of individual decision-makers are determined through laboratory experiments. The interactions of these suppliers and retailers are then simulated using an ABS to generate a large sample set of decisions. With only a small number of participants, we demonstrate that it is possible to produce similar results to previous experimental studies that involved much larger sample sizes. We conclude that ABS provides the potential to extend the scope of experimental research in behavioural operational research.

AB Purpose: To evaluate the influence of two desensitizers (Gluma Desensitizer and Hyposen) on the tensile bond strength of three different dentin adhesives. Methods: 90 freshly extracted third molars were specially prepared to allow simulation of dentin perfusion. The specimens were divided at random into nine groups: Group AC: Clearfil New Bond/Clearfil Core; Group AX: Xeno III/Tetric Flow; Group AA: AdheSE/Tetric Flow; Group BC: Gluma/Clearfil New Bond/Clearfil Core; Group BX: Gluma/Xeno III/Tetric Flow; Group BA: Gluma/AdheSE/Tetric Flow; Group CC: Hyposen/Clearfil New Bond/Clearfil Core; Group CX: Hyposen/Xeno III/Tetric Flow; Group CA: Hyposen/AdheSE/Tetric Flow. Tensile bond strength of the above mentioned bonding agents was measured using a universal testing machine. Results: The following tensile bond strengths were obtained (mean values and standard deviations in MPa): Group AC: 11.05 +/- 1.92, Group AX: 6.01 +/- 1.35, Group AA: 8.91 +/- 1.20, Group BC: 10.25 +/- 1.44, Group BX: 7.17 +/- 1.24, Group BA: 10.35 +/- 1.26, group CC: 8.11 +/- 0.70, Group CX: 8.03 +/- 1.20, Group CA: 9.22 +/- 1.75. Statistical analysis showed a significant influence of the variable, dentin bonding agent on tensile bond strength (ANOVA, Tukey's, P< 0.05). Treatment with Hyposen in combination with Clearfil New Bond resulted in significantly lower bond strength values. Gluma had no significant influence on bond strength of the three adhesive systems. Within the limitations of an in. vitro investigation it can be concluded that Gluma did not significantly affect the bond strength of any of the adhesive systems tested. Hyposen significantly decreased the bond strength values of Clearfil New Bond. (Am J Dent 2008;21:388-392).

AB Hydroxyapatite/polyamide-66 (HA/PA66) composite scaffolds were prepared using injection-molding technique and also analyzed by means of scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and mechanical testing. Compared with common methods to fabricate scaffolds, this process can fabricate composite scaffolds in a rapid and convenient manner by adjusting the experimental conditions of foaming agent and shot size. The interactions between PA66 and HA particles affect the crystallization behavior of PA66 and the pore structure of scaffolds. HA particles can increase the stiffness of composite scaffolds accompanied by the reduction of impact strength, pore size and porosity. The obtained 40 wt% HA/PA66 composite scaffolds with a pore size ranging from 100-500 mu m and a porosity more than 65% can simultaneously meet the requirements of porous structure and mechanical performance.

DE Nonlinear opinion dynamics; Social networks; Imperfect pitchfork
   bifurcation
AB Opinion dynamics of a group of individuals is the change in the members' opinions through mutual interaction with each other. The related literature contains works in which the dynamics is modeled as a continuous system, of which behavioral patterns are analyzed in regard to the parameters contained in the system. These models are constructed by the assumption that the individuals are interdependent. Besides, the decisions of the individuals are only affected by two forces: self-bias force and group influence force. In this work, a nonlinear dynamical system which models the evolution of the decision of a group under the existence of a leader is considered. The two well-known opinion evolutions Friedkin-Johnsen and Hegselmann-Krause models are incorporated with a nonlinear exponentially decaying interaction potential to analyze the dynamics. The model considered in this work, which reflects simultaneously the effect of a leader and a nonlinear potential in the group dynamics, is analyzed the first time in the literature. Through this mechanism, the aim of the study is to understand the transitions between the final stable situations of the system which can be agreement, majority rule or disagreement. Bifurcation analysis of the system is performed to obtain stability results on the system. It is shown that one of these transition mechanisms is an imperfect pitchfork bifurcation. The study successfully produces boundary curves of the different regions in the parameter space that separates the stable states. The results of the work well present the distinctions between these final situations analytically, in case of N = 3 agents plus a leader. The group mechanism considered is promising in the sense of having possible further modeling opportunities. For a large N number of people, clusters of opinions can be studied numerically, for analyzing how a leader can affect a big group of agents. The same can be tried for a big community with several leaders, which can represent the dynamics of electoral processes. The basic construction in this work will be a starting point for such further analyses. (C) 2021 International Association for Mathematics and Computers in Simulation (IMACS).

AB Understanding household labor and land allocation decisions under agro-environmental policies is challenging due to complex human-environment interactions. Here, we developed a spatially explicit agent-based model based on spatial and socioeconomic data to simulate households' land and labor allocation decisions and investigated the impacts of two forest restoration and conservation programs and one agricultural subsidy program in rural China. Simulation outputs revealed that the forest restoration program accelerates labor out-migration and cropland shrink, while the forest conservation program promotes livelihood diversification via increasing non-farm employment. Meanwhile, the agricultural subsidy program keeps labor for cultivation on land parcels with good quality, but appears less effective for preventing marginal croplands from being abandoned. The policy effects on labor allocation substantially differ between rules based on bounded rational and empirical knowledge of defining household decisions, particularly on sending labor out-migrants and engaging in local off-farm jobs. Land use patterns showed that the extent to which households pursue economic benefits through shrinking cultivated land is generally greater under bounded rationality than empirical knowledge. Findings demonstrate nonlinear social-ecological impacts of the agro-environmental policies through time, which can deviate from expectations due to complex interplays between households and land. This study also suggests that the spatial agent-based model can represent adaptive decision-making and interactions of human agents and their interactions in dynamic social and physical environments.

AB The paper presents a stock-flow consistent agent-based model with effective demand, endogenous credit creation, and labor-saving technological progress. The aim is to study the joint dynamics of both personal and functional distribution of income as a result of technological unemployment, together with the effect on household debt. Numerical simulations show the potentially destabilizing effect of technological unemployment and reveal that an increase in the profit share of income amplifies the negative effect of income inequality on the business cycle and growth. The sensitivity analysis provides indications on the effectiveness of possible mixes of fiscal and redistributive policies, but also demonstrates that the effectiveness of policy measures is strongly dependent on behavioral and institutional factors.

DE Agent-Based Modelling; Equation-Based Modelling; Congestion Game; Model

AB In this work simulation-based and analytical results on the emergence steady states in traffic-like interactions are presented and discussed. The objective of the paper is twofold: i) investigating the role of social conventions in coordination problem situations, and more specifically in congestion games; ii) comparing simulation-based and analytical results to figure out what these methodologies can tell us on the subject matter. Our main issue is that Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) and the Equation-Based Modelling (EBM) are not alternative, but in some circumstances complementary, and suggest some features distinguishing these two ways of modeling that go beyond the practical considerations provided by Parunak H. V. D., Robert Savit and Rick L. Riolo. Our model is based on the interaction of strategies of heterogeneous agents who have to cross a junction. In each junction there are only four inputs, each of which is passable only in the direction of the intersection and can be occupied only by an agent one at a time. The results generated by ABM simulations provide structured data for developing the analytical model through which generalizing the simulation results and make predictions. ABM simulations are artifacts that generate empirical data on the basis of the variables, properties, local rules and critical factors the modeler decides to implement into the model; in this way simulations allow generating controlled data, useful to test the theory and reduce the complexity, while EBM allows to close them, making thus possible to falsify them.

AB Dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP), which acted as the simulant of nerve warfare agents, was degraded by strong ionization discharge gas. Experimental results show that DMMP could be degraded rapidly by the strong ionization discharge gas, and the total organic carbon of the solution decreased significantly. Moreover, the free radical accelerant and inhibitors significantly influenced the degradation efficiencies of DMMP. Free radicals were the most important oxidants for the DMMP degradation reaction in this system. Hydroxyl radical could attack CH3-P, P-OCH3 and O-CH3 groups of DMMP to start a degradation reaction. The analysis of byproducts indicated that phosphate esters, methyl phosphoric acid, PO43- and CO2 etc. were formed after the treatment. Furthermore, DMMP would be probably mineralized. Finally, four reaction pathways were predicted for the DMMP degradation by the strong ionization discharge gas.

AB In this work we study the critical behavior of a three-state (+1, 1, 0) opinion model with independence. Each agent has a probability q to act as independent, i.e., he/she can choose his/her opinion independently of the opinions of the other agents. On the other hand, with the complementary probability 1 q the agent interacts with a randomly chosen individual through a kinetic exchange. Our analytical and numerical results show that the independence mechanism acts as a noise that induces an order-disorder transition at critical points q(c) that depend on the individuals' flexibility. For a special value of this flexibility the system undergoes a transition to an absorbing state with all opinions 0. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We present and numerically investigate a quadruple co-evolutionary model for 2 x 2 Prisoner's Dilemma games which allows not only for agents to adopt strategy (Cooperation C or Defection D) and for network topology, but also for the probability of link rewiring that controls the speed of network evolution and the updating rule itself. The results of a series of simulations reveal that C agents in a coexisting phase increase their rewiring probability to avoid neighboring D agents' exploitation through the Game Exit Option. This evolutionary process leads most agents to adopt pairwise updating even though Imitation Max update adopted by all agents brings a higher payoff.

Three important findings are identified in this research. First, the proposed approach can estimate fluctuations of electricity prices as well as other well-known methods such as neural networks and genetic algorithms. Second, multiple learning capabilities incorporated in adaptive agents do not have an advantage over limited learning capabilities in predicting the market price of electricity. Finally, a theoretical extension of multiple learning capabilities may have potential for developing the agent-based approach for power trading.

LA English

DE Agent-based modelling; housing; urban dynamics; Airbnb
AB Gentrification, displacement and social exclusion are hot topics of debate in the city of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. A current phenomena is short-term rentals of private homes. In its peer-to-peer form, this phenomena has grown sharply, facilitated by services such as Airbnb. Its growth has caused controversies among communities in touristic areas of Amsterdam, since it contributes to a changed social fabric, increased housing prices and overall gentrification. In the Netherlands and elsewhere, municipal and national policy makers are interested to regulate short-term rentals. In order to provide insights into qualitative policy effects, we develop a micro-level agent-based simulation. Our spatial model simulates residential migration based on income and house pricing. The underlying economic theory is that of Smith's rent-gap hypothesis. Our model is among the first agent-based approaches investigating this type of rental market, and the first to model a specific housing market, including social housing, in a geographically accurate way. Simulation analysis shows that the touristic rental market has caused considerable changes in housing prices and population development. We find that more lower income citizens remain in the city centre when regulation of the market is stronger, and that banning the touristic market restrains the overall increase in house prices, compared to the business-as-usual scenario. However, the feasibility of enforcement of regulation, and its libertarian consequences, must be considered.

AB The two-agent scheduling problem has a wide range of applications in real world. Although uncertainty is ubiquitous in real world, research of the two-agent scheduling problem under uncertain environment is rare. For applications where historical data is not abundant, investigation of this problem under fuzzy environment is necessary. This paper studies the two-agent scheduling problem under fuzzy environment. We assume that the processing time of each job and the weights that the agents assign to the jobs are fuzzy variables, and focus on the problem where the cost of one agent is the maximum weighted completion time of her jobs and the cost of the other agent is the sum of the weighted completion time of her jobs. Based on three different decision criteria, we present three concepts of schedule and three fuzzy programming models respectively. In order to solve the proposed models, we design a hybrid intelligent algorithm that integrates fuzzy simulation with genetic algorithm. Numerical experiments are given to show the effectiveness of the models and the algorithm.

AB Shrinking cities are characterized by a huge oversupply of dwellings and resulting residential vacancies. Discussions among urban planners and policymakers in Europe have focused on the consequences of urban shrinkage following demographic transition, fertility decline and individualization. In this study, the shrinking city of Leipzig in Eastern Germany is singled out as a case basis for the study of residential mobility and land use change using agent-based modeling techniques, in which social scientists developed a concept of household types based on empirical data that form a unique base: these techniques were used to construct a data-driven, agent-based model. The spatially explicit simulation model RESMOBcity presented here 'translates' these empirical data via behavioral rules of households. It computes spatially explicit household patterns, housing demands and residential vacancies. Based on three scenarios, population growth, stagnation and shrinkage, we show that population might stabilize within the coming years. The number of households is expected to further increase. We demonstrate that a selective demolition of vacant housing stock can counteract the enormous oversupply of dwellings and better balance housing demand and the number of available flats. Scenario simulation shows that the model can reproduce observed patterns of population, inner-urban migration and residential vacancy in a spatially explicit manner and thus can be applied to the analysis of scenarios of demographic change in urban regions. The presented model acts as a tool supporting the testing of hypotheses in social science research and allowing the quantification of land-use scenarios in urban regions based on household choices.

AB Naturalistic decision making (NDM) focuses on how people actually make decisions in realistic settings that typically involve ill-structured problems. Taking an experimental approach, we investigate the impacts of using an NDM-based software agent (R-CAST) on the performance of human decision-making teams in a simulated C3I (Communications, Command, Control and Intelligence) environment. We examined four types of decision-making teams with mixed human and agent members playing the roles of intelligence collection and command selection. The experiment also involved two within-group control variables: task complexity and context switching frequency. The result indicates that the use of an R-CAST agent in intelligence collection allows its team member to consider the latest situational information in decision making but might increase the team member's cognitive load. It also indicates that a human member playing the role of command selection should not rely too much on the agent serving as his or her decision aid. Together, it is suggested that the roles of both humans and cognitive agents are critical for achieving the best possible performance of C3I decision-making teams: Whereas agents are superior in computation-intensive activities such as information seeking and filtering, humans are superior in projecting and reasoning about dynamic situations and more adaptable to teammates' cognitive capacities. This study has demonstrated that cognitive agents empowered with NDM models can serve as the teammates and decision aids of human decision makers. Advanced decision support systems built upon such team-aware agents could help achieve reduced cognitive load and effective human-agent collaboration.

Our study on innovation practice and culture in the Westland horticulture sector served to explore what information and data from ethnographic analysis could be used in models and how. MAIA, a framework for agent-based model development of social systems, is our starting point for structuring and translating said knowledge into a model. The data that was collected through an ethnographic process served as input to the agent-based model. We also used the theoretical analysis performed on the data to define outcome variables for the simulation. We conclude by proposing an initial methodology that describes the use of ethnography in modelling.

AB This paper uses a mixed method approach to show how cross-cultural differences in social influences can explain differences in distributions of market shares in different markets. First, we develop a realistic agent-based model that mimics the behavior of movie visitors and incorporates the social influences visitors exert on each other before and after visiting movies. The simulation results indicate that market inequalities are determined by social influences. In particular, we find that the social influence derived from the intended behaviors of others (coordinated consumption effect) has a stronger effect on market inequalities than the social influence derived from the past behavior of others (imitation effect). Second, we empirically validate the simulation results by conducting a cross-national survey that makes use of the cross-cultural differences in Hofstede's collectivism-individualism index as a proxy for the level of social influence present in a market. The results of this field study, performed in China, the Netherlands, Italy, and Spain, empirically show that social influences differ across countries, and that these differences can explain the apparent differences in the dispersion of movies' market shares. The empirical survey further contributes to understanding the role of social influence by revealing a U-shaped relationship between Hofstede's collectivism-individualism index score and the degree of social influence.

TI Discrete opinion dynamics on networks based on social influence

LA English
DT Article
ID MODEL; EVOLUTION; INFORMATION
AB A model of opinion dynamics based on social influence on networks was studied. The opinion of each agent can have integer values i = 1, 2, ..., I and opinion exchanges are restricted to connected agents. It was found that for any I >= 2 and self-confidence parameter 0 <= u < 1, when u is a degree-independent constant, the weighted proportion < q(i)> of the population that hold a given opinion i is a martingale, and the fraction q(i) of opinion i will gradually converge to < q(i)>. The tendency can slow down with the increase of degree assortativity of networks. When u is degree dependent, < q(i)> does not possess the martingale property, however q(i) still converges to it. In both cases for a finite network the states of all agents will finally reach consensus. Further if there exist stubborn persons in the population whose opinions do not change over time, it was found that for degree-independent constant u, both q(i) and < q(i)> will converge to fixed proportions which only depend on the distribution of initial obstinate persons, and naturally the final equilibrium state will be the coexistence of diverse opinions held by the stubborn people. The analytical results were verified by numerical simulations on Barabasi-Albert (BA) networks. The model highlights the influence of high-degree agents on the final consensus or coexistence state and captures some realistic features of the diffusion of opinions in social networks.

ID CROWD DYNAMICS; BEHAVIOR; FLOW
AB Simulation models of pedestrian dynamics have become an invaluable tool for evacuation planning. Typically, crowds are assumed to stream unidirectionally towards a safe area. Simulated agents avoid collisions through mechanisms that belong to each individual, such as being repelled from each other by imaginary forces. But classic locomotion models fail when collective cooperation is called for, notably when an agent, say a first-aid attendant, needs to forge a path through a densely packed group. We present a controlled experiment to observe what happens when humans pass through a dense static crowd. We formulate and test hypotheses on salient phenomena. We discuss our observations in a psychological framework. We derive a model that incorporates: agents' perception and cognitive processing of a situation that needs cooperation; selection from a portfolio of behaviours, such as being cooperative; and a suitable action, such as swapping places. Agents' ability to successfully get through a dense crowd emerges as an effect of the psychological model.

AB We propose two modeling approaches to describe the dynamics of ant battles, starting from laboratory experiments on the behavior of two ant species, the invasive Lasius neglectus and the authocthonus Lasius paralienus. This work is mainly motivated by the need to have realistic models to predict the interaction dynamics of invasive species. The two considered species exhibit different fighting strategies. In order to describe the observed battle dynamics, we start by building a chemical model considering the ants and the fighting groups (for instance two ants of a species and one of the other one) as a chemical species. From the chemical equations we deduce a system of differential equations, whose parameters are estimated by minimizing the difference between the experimental data and the model output. We model the fluctuations observed in the experiments by means of a standard Gillespie algorithm. In order to better reproduce the observed behavior, we adopt a spatial agent-based model, in which ants not engaged in fighting groups move randomly (diffusion) among compartments, and the Gillespie algorithm is used to model the reactions inside a compartment.

AB Recent technological advancements bring virtual agents, avatars, and social robotic characters into our daily lives. These characters must acquire the ability to express (simulated) emotions vocally and gesturally. In the vocal channel, Natural Language Interaction technologies today have some limitations when used in real-world natural environments and the models of expressivity of text to speech synthesis engines are not yet mature enough. To address these limitations, an alternative form of vocal communication - gibberish speech - is introduced in this paper. Gibberish speech consists of vocalizations of meaningless strings of speech sounds, and thus has no semantic meaning. It is occasionally used by performing artists or for cartoon animations and games to express intended emotions (e.g. Teletubbies and The Sims). In this paper, our approach for constructing expressive gibberish speech is described and the experimental evaluations with its intended robotic agents are reported. It is shown that the generated gibberish speech can contribute to a significant extent to studies concerning emotion expression for robotic agents and can be further utilized in affective human-robot interaction studies.

AB We argue that building agent-based and equation-based versions of the same theoretical model is a fruitful way of gaining insights into real-world phenomena. We use the epistemological concept of models as isolations and surrogate systems as the philosophical underpinning of this argument. In particular, we show that agent-based and equation-based approaches align well when used simultaneously and, contrary to some common misconceptions, should be considered complements rather than substitutes. We illustrate the usefulness of the approach by examining a model of the long-run relationship between economic development and inequality (i.e., the Kuznets hypothesis).

AB Relatively large thermal gradients may exist during exposure of an animal to microwaves (MWs), particularly at high frequencies. Differences in thermal gradients within the body may lead to noticeable differences in the magnitude of cardiovascular changes resulting from MW exposure. This study compares the thermal distribution and cardiovascular effects of exposure to a single MW frequency with effects of simultaneous exposure to two frequencies. Ketamine-anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 58) were exposed individually to one of three conditions: 1-GHz, 10-GHz, or combined 1- and 10-GHz MWs at an equivalent whole-body specific absorption rate of 12 W/kg. The continuous-wave irradiation was conducted under far-field conditions with animals in E orientation (left lateral exposure, long axis parallel to the electric field) or in H orientation (left lateral exposure, long axis perpendicular to the electric field). Irradiation was started when colonic temperature was 37.5 degrees C and was continued until lethal temperatures were attained. Colonic, tympanic, left and right subcutaneous, and tail temperatures, and arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate were continuously recorded. In both E and Il orientations, survival time (i.e., time from colonic temperature of 37.5 degrees C until death) was lowest in animals exposed at 1-GHz, intermediate in those exposed at 1- and 10-GHz combined, and greatest in the 10-GHz group (most differences statistically significant). At all sites (with the exception of right subcutaneous), temperature values in the 1- and 10-GHz combined group were between those of the single-frequency exposure groups in both E and H orientations. During irradiation, arterial blood pressure initially increased and then decreased until death. Heart rate increased throughout the exposure period. The general, overall patterns of these changes were similar in all groups. The results indicate that no unusual physiological responses occur during multi-frequency MW exposure, when compared with results of single-frequency exposure. Published 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.(dagger)

AB A key component of social understanding is the ability to read intentions from movements. But how do we discern intentions in others' actions? What kind of intention information is actually available in the features of others' movements? Based on the assumption that intentions are hidden away in the other person's mind, standard theories of social cognition have mainly focused on the contribution of higher level processes. Here, we delineate an alternative approach to the problem of intention-from-movement understanding. We argue that intentions become "visible" in the surface flow of agents' motions. Consequently, the ability to understand others' intentions cannot be divorced from the capability to detect essential kinematics. This hypothesis has far reaching implications for how we know other minds and predict others' behavior.

ID PREMIUM; RISK
AB In a representative agent model, the behavior of a social system is described in terms of a single aggregate decision maker. Such models are popular in economic and finance research, largely due to their analytic tractability, but fail to account for real-world agent heterogeneity, and may ignore effects of market microstructure. Agent-based simulation models naturally incorporate agent heterogeneity, and can account for any particular market microstructure; however, such models have gained only limited acceptance by the mainstream economic research community, due to concerns over how much general insight can be gleaned from simulating a particular configuration of agent behaviors. We address such concerns by employing game-theoretic criteria in behavior selection. We present a case study investigating a recent model from the finance literature proposed by Epstein and Schneider (ES), and its ability to explain the classic equity premium puzzle in risky asset pricing. For all market configurations that we examined, ambiguity-averse pricing was played with little or no probability in equilibrium. Moreover, none of the market configurations exhibited significant equity premia. Both our use of strategic equilibrium as a market composition concept, and the actions of our simulated market microstructure contribute to removing any equity premium. These findings underscore the value of checking that results from abstract representative-agent models are supportable in a higher-fidelity model where heterogeneity and strategic interactions are taken into account.

AB Motor imagery is defined as a dynamic state during which the representation of a given motor act is internally rehearsed without overt motor output. Some evidence in experimental psychology has suggested that imagery ability is crucial for the correct understanding of social intention. The present study was conducted first to confirm that the nature of the motor intention leads to early modulations of movement kinematics. Secondly, we tested whether humans use imagery to read an agent's intention when observing the very first element of a complex action sequence. Results revealed early variations in movement kinematics between three different social actions and further showed that human agents can use these early deviants to anticipate above chance level the end-result before seeing the second half of the sequence. Response times in the observation task were similar in duration to those measured in the true production task, suggesting the use of motor imagery for trial categorization. Nevertheless, in a third study, the use of an artificial ( neural network) classifier demonstrated that classification within the first 500 ms is possible without cognitive imagery processing. Hence, our results suggest that low-level motor indices afford intention reading without need for motor imagery but that human agents may use imaging beyond simulation to create an embodied sense of interactivity.

AB The hypothesis that fowl adenovirus (FAV) and chicken anemia virus (CAV), transmitted vertically and simultaneously induce the inclusion body hepatitis (IBH)/hydropericardium (HP) syndrome in progeny chickens was tested. Thus, 35-wk-old light brown layer breeders, showing absence of antibodies against FAV and variable titers against CAV, were intramuscularly singly infected with the FAV serotype 4 isolate 341 or dually infected with CAV (isolate 10343) and FAV. All hens (groups A [FAV alone], B [FAV + CAV], and C [noninfected]) were clinically healthy throughout the experimental period. Both infectious viruses FAV and CAV were isolated from progenies obtained as early as 5 days after infection of their breeders. Hematocrit, serum proteins, and aspartate-aminotransferase values showed a few statistical differences between the progeny groups. Most of these differences were detected in the progeny chickens of group B. However, almost all values met reference values for the species. The pathologic findings showed that progeny chickens obtained from both singly and dually infected breeders developed macroscopic and histopathologic changes of IBH/HP. The pathologic findings shown by progeny chickens of group A (FAV) were not expected because neither synergism nor prior immunodepression by CAV was concurrent. Chickens of group B (CAV + FAV) also developed IBM/HP! Although not many differences in the evaluated parameters between groups A and B were statistically significant, most pathologic findings of group B indicated a more severe manifestation of the disease. However, because FAV alone did reproduce the syndrome, the results shown by group B would not allow a definitive confirmation of the hypothesis that the association of FAV and CAV is necessary for the successful induction of the IBH/HP syndrome in chickens when transmitted vertically.

   Design/methodology/approach - The authors establish understanding of the fundamental mechanism of information cascades through a computational simulation approach.
   Findings - Eigenvector centrality, betweenness centrality, and PageRank are statistically correlated with the occurrence of information cascades among agents; the hubs' incorrect decisions in the early diffusion stage can significantly cause misled shift cascades; and the bridge role of hubs is more influential than their pivotal position role in the process of misled shift cascades.
   Originality/value - This implication can be extendable in the field of marketing, sequential voting, and technology, or innovation adoption.

ID ROLLBACK-RECOVERY
AB The flexibility offered by mobile agents is quite noticeable in distributed computing environments. However, the greater flexibility of the mobile agent paradigm compared to the client/server computing paradigm comes at an additional threats since agent systems are prone to failures originating from bad communication, security attacks, agent server crashes, system resources unavailability, network congestion, or even deadlock situations. In such events, mobile agents either get lost or damaged (partially or totally) during execution. In this paper, we propose parallel checkpointing approach based on the use of antecedence graphs for providing fault tolerance in mobile agent systems. During normal computation message transmission, the dependency information among mobile agents is recorded in the form of antecedence graphs by participating mobile agents of mobile agent group. When a checkpointing procedure begins, the initiator concurrently informs relevant mobile agents, which minimizes the identifying time. The proposed scheme utilizes the checkpointed information for fault tolerance which is stored in form of antecedence graphs. In case of failures, using checkpointed information, the antecedence graphs and message logs are regenerated for recovery and then normal operation continued. Moreover, compared with the existing schemes, our algorithm involves the minimum number of mobile agents during the identifying and checkpoiting procedure, which leads to the improvement of the system performance. In addition, the proposed algorithm is a domino-free checkpointing algorithm, which is especially desirable for mobile agent systems. Quantitative analysis and experimental simulation show that our algorithm outperforms other coordinated checkpointing schemes in terms of the identifying time and the number of blocked mobile agents and then can provide a better system performance. The main contribution of the proposed checkpointing scheme is the enhancement of graph-based approach in terms of considerable improvement by reducing message overhead, execution, and recovery times.

AB We study the mutual influence of authority and persuasion in the flow of opinions. We describe a simple model with no social mobility, where each agent belongs to a class in the hierarchy and has also a persuasion capability. Agents use the force of its persuasion to propagate their opinions; however a high-rank agent can also use its authority to impose its opinion on other ones. The model is studied analytically within a mean field approximation and by means of numerical simulations. In the case of a three authority level hierarchy the agreement between the two approaches is excellent. We obtain a phase diagram identifying the relative frequency of the prevailing opinions, and find that the stratum where the dominant opinion arises from is strongly dependent on the relative population of each hierarchy level. The time evolution shows that conflicting opinions polarize after a short transient. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Army ants perform the altruism behavior that an ant sacrifices its own well-being for the benefit of another ants. They build bridges using their own bodies along the path from a food to the nest. We developed the army ant inspired social evolutionary system by using Swarm library. The system has 2 kinds of ant agents, 'Major ant' and 'Minor ant'. They communicate with each other via pheromones. Army ant can recognize them as the signals from the other ants. The pheromones evaporate with the certain ratio and diffused into the space of neighbors stochastically. If the optimal bridge is found, the path through the bridge is the shortest route from the food to the nest. We define the probability for an ant to leave a bridge as to the number of neighboring ants. The constructing method of the optimal route has been proposed. In this paper, the behaviors of ant under the environment with two or more feeding spots were observed. Some experimental results show the behaviors of great interest with respect to altruism of ants. The knowledge discovery of social evolutionary process from some computer simulation results is described in this paper.

AB Agent-Based Modelling is gaining wider acceptance as a paradigm for social research. However, it still presents limitations in the management of the process to generate the simulations from the initial conceptual models. This makes it difficult to reuse the knowledge from available models and to adapt it to different hypotheses. This paper proposes the use of metamodels in order to define explicitly the core concepts of a problem domain and to differentiate the aspects involved in the process. A case study for posted pricing institutions shows how to define the related metamodel and use it to address alternative situations in these auctions. The case study drives the discussion on the advantages and limitations that metamodelling can bring to social simulation.

The behavioral rules of the artificial agents are modeled on the basis of prior evidence from human subject experiments. Simulations of the artificial agent-based model are conducted in two new versions of the Kiyotaki-Wright environment and yield some testable predictions. These predictions are examined using data from new, human subject experiments. The results are encouraging and suggest that artificial agent-based modeling may be a useful device for both understanding and designing human subject experiments. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB In this paper we investigate the effects of social power on the evolution of opinions in model networks as well as in a number of real social networks. A continuous opinion formation model is considered and the analysis is performed through numerical simulation. Social power is given to a proportion of agents selected either randomly or based on their degrees. As artificial network structures, we consider scale-free networks constructed through preferential attachment and Watts-Strogatz networks. Numerical simulations show that scale-free networks with degree-based social power on the hub nodes have an optimal case where the largest number of the nodes reaches a consensus. However, given power to a random selection of nodes could not improve consensus properties. Introducing social power in Watts Strogatz networks could not significantly change the consensus profile.

AB To overcome the limitations of neoclassical economics, researchers have leveraged tools of statistical physics to build novel theories. The idea was to elucidate the macroscopic features of financial markets from the interaction of its microscopic constituents, the investors. In this framework, the model of the financial agents has been kept separate from that of their interaction. Here, instead, we explore the possibility of letting the interaction topology emerge from the model of the agents' behavior. Then, we investigate how the emerging cobweb of relationship affects the overall market dynamics. To this aim, we leverage tools from complex systems analysis and nonlinear dynamics, and model the network of mutual influence as the output of a dynamical system describing the edge evolution. In this work, the driver of the link evolution is the relative reputation between possibly coupled agents. The reputation is built differently depending on the extent of rationality of the investors. The continuous edge activation or deactivation induces the emergence of leaders and of peculiar network structures, typical of real influence networks. The subsequent impact on the market dynamics is investigated through extensive numerical simulations in selected scenarios populated by partially rational investors.

ID SNOWDRIFT GAME; DYNAMICS
AB Anisotropic strategies are introduced and studied numerically and analytically in the context of prisoner's dilemma (PD) played in a system of connected agents for their effects on the evolution of cooperation. For an agent competing with k neighbors, an anisotropic strategy has k entries representing the different actions against each of the opponents. The commonly used cooperative and non-cooperative strategies against all opponents are isotropic and special cases of anisotropic strategies. For evolutionary PD based on a death-birth process in dynamically formed competing groups, selection results in a totally non-cooperative state but the dynamics is altered by the anisotropic strategies. For agents connected by static networks having a uniform degree, the cooperative level exhibits plateaux as the temptation payoff increases. The plateaux represent the dominance of different classes of anisotropic strategies with decreasing cooperative entries. Dynamical equations with results in good agreement with simulation results on the evolution of strategies and the long time behavior are constructed. For static networks with a spread in degrees, the plateaux disappear except for the one corresponding to a totally cooperative population. For all cases, anisotropic strategies are found to maintain a cooperative level no less than that in a corresponding system in which only isotropic strategies are in play for high temptation payoffs. Anisotropic strategies suggest an alternative mechanism for enhancing cooperation in PD and other games that is worthy of further investigations. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Agent-based social simulation is well-known for generative explanations. Following the theory of thick descriptionwe extend the generative paradigm to interpretative research in cultural studies. Using the example of qualitative data about criminal culture, the paper describes a research process that facilitates interpretative research by growing virtual cultures. Relying on qualitative data for the development of agent rules, the research process combines several steps: Qualitative data analysis following the Grounded Theory paradigm enables concept identification, resulting in the development of a conceptual model of the concept relations. The software tool CCD is used in conceptual modelling which assists semi-automatic transformation in a simulation model developed in the simulation platform DRAMS. Both tools preserve traceability to the empirical evidence throughout the research process. Traceability enables interpretation of simulations by generating a narrative storyline of the simulation. Thereby simulation enables a qualitative exploration of textual data. The whole process generates a thick description of the subject of study, in our example criminal culture. The simulation is characterized by a socio-cognitive coupling of agents' reasoning on the state of the mind of other agents. This reveals a thick description of how participants make sense of the phenomenology of a situation from the perspective of their world-view.

AB Heterogeneous, "aggregated" patterns in the spatial distributions of individuals are almost universal across living organisms, from bacteria to higher vertebrates. Whereas specific features of aggregations are often visually striking to human eyes, a heuristic analysis based on human vision is usually not sufficient to answer fundamental questions about how and why organisms aggregate. What are the individual-level behavioral traits that give rise to these features? When qualitatively similar spatial patterns arise from purely physical mechanisms, are these patterns in organisms biologically significant, or are they simply epiphenomena that are likely characteristics of any set of interacting autonomous individuals? If specific features of spatial aggregations do confer advantages or disadvantages in the fitness of group members, how has evolution operated to shape individual behavior in balancing costs and benefits at the individual and group levels? Mathematical models of social behaviors such as schooling in fishes provide a promising avenue to address some of these questions. However, the literature on schooling models has lacked a common framework to objectively and quantitatively characterize relationships between individual-level behaviors and group-level patterns. In this paper, we briefly survey similarities and differences in behavioral algorithms and aggregation statistics among existing schooling models. We present preliminary results of our efforts to develop a modeling framework that synthesizes much of this previous work, and to identify relationships between behavioral parameters and group-level statistics.

AB A general microscopic interaction model is proposed to describe the changes in the physical properties of phospholipid bilayer membranes due to foreign molecules which, to different degrees, partition between the membrane phases and the aqueous environment.  The model is a multi-state lattice model for the main phase transition of lipid bilayers and the foreign molecules are assumed to intercalate as intestitials in the lattice.  By varying the model parameters, the diversity in the thermodynamic properties of the model is explored using computer-simulation techniques which faithfully take account of the thermal fluctuations.  The calculations are performed in both the canonical and the grand canonical ensembles corresponding to the cases where the concentration of foreign molecules in the membrane is either fixed or varies as the external conditions are changed.  A classification of the diverse thermal behaviour, specifically with regard to the phase diagram, the specific heat, the density fluctuations, and the partition coefficient, is suggested with a view to rationalizing a large body of experimental measurements of the effects of different foreign molecules on membrane properties.  The range of foreign molecules considered includes compounds as diverse as volatile general anaesthetics like halothane, cocaine-derived local anaesthetics like procaine, calcium-channel blocking drugs like verapamil, antidepressants like chlorpromazine, and anti-cancer agents like adriamycin.

AB Ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) are designed to be used below 10 MHz, but interest is growing in studying the response of agents to high-frequency ultrasound. In this study, the subharmonic response of polymer-shelled UCAs with a mean diameter of 1.1 mu m excited with 40-MHz tone-bursts of 1-20 cycles was analyzed. UCAs were diluted in water and streamed through a flow phantom that permitted single-bubble backscatter events to be acquired at peak-negative pressures from 0.75 to 5.0 MPa. At each exposure condition, 1000 single-bubble-backscatter events were digitized. Subharmonic content at 20 MHz was screened using a conventional and a singular-value-decomposition (SVD) method. The conventional method evaluated each event spectrum individually while the SVD method treated the 1000-event data set at one time. A subharmonic score (SHS) indicative of how much subharmonic content a 1000-event data set contained was computed for both methods. Empirical-simulation results indicated that SHSs obtained from the two methods were linearly related. Also, experimental data with both methods indicated that subharmonic likelihood increased with pulse duration and peaked near 2 MPa. The SVD method also yielded quantitative information about subharmonic events not available with the conventional method. (C) 2009 Acoustical Society of America. [DOI: 10.1121/1.3117384]

AB A Kinetic analysis or living/controlled radical polymerizations in bulk mediated by RAFT is presented The main objective is to show how the kinetics of the RAFT process and, in particular, of the RAFT intermediate radical is affecting the overall polymerization rate. Namely, three different cases are analyzed: (i) slow fragmentation of the RAFT intermediate; (ii) cross-termination of the RAFT intermediate with other radicals; and,(iii) slow re-initiation 1 2 of the RAFT agent leaving group. Simplified analytical formulas are derived for the time-dependent concentrations of the involved species as well as for conversion. They are supported by numerical simulations and are qualitatively compared to literature experimental findings. Criteria are also given to judge the influence of the RAFT reaction I kinetic rate constants on the different phenomena observed experimentally in RAFT polymerization, namely inhibition and retardation. Since these criteria are given by using non-dimensional groups, they can be readily applied to a broad spectrum of experimental conditions.

AB For group-living animals to remain cohesive they must agree on where to travel. Theoretical models predict shared group decisions should be favoured, and a number of empirical examples support this. However, the behavioural mechanisms that underpin shared decision-making are not fully understood. Groups may achieve consensus of direction by active communication of individual preferences (i.e. voting), or by responding to each other's orientation and movement (i.e. copying). For example, African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) are reported to use body orientation to vote and indicate their preferred direction to achieve a consensus on travel direction, while golden shiners (Notemigonus crysoleucas) achieve consensus of direction by responding to the movement cues of their neighbours. Here, we present a conceptual model (supported by agent-based simulations) that allows us to distinguish patterns of motion that represent voting or copying. We test our model predictions using high-resolution GPS and magnetometer data collected from a herd of free-ranging goats (Capra aegagrus hircus) in the Namib Desert, Namibia. We find that decisions concerning travel direction were more consistent with individuals copying one another's motion and find no evidence to support the use of voting with body orientation. Our findings highlight the role of simple behavioural rules for collective decision-making by animal groups.

AB This article models the learning process of a population of randomly rematched tabula rasa neural network agents playing randomly generated 3 x 3 normal form games of all strategic types. Evidence was found of the endogenous emergence of a similarity measure of games based on the number and types of Nash equilibria, and of heuristics that have been found effective in describing human behavior in experimental one-shot games. The neural network agents were found to approximate experimental human behavior very well across various dimensions such as convergence to Nash equilibria, equilibrium selection, and adherence to principles of dominance and iterated dominance. This is corroborated by evidence from five studies of experimental one-shot games, because the Spearman correlation coefficients of the probability distribution over the neural networks' and human subjects' actions ranged from 0.49 to 0.89.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of alpha-tricalcium phosphate (alpha-TCP) in the physical-chemical properties of an experimental adhesive resin and to analyze the immediate and long-term properties of caries-affected dentin (CAD) after selective removal to soft dentin restored with or without the alpha-TCP group. An experimental adhesive resin was formulated with BisGMA, HEMA (66.66:33.33 wt%), and a photoinitiator system. alpha-TCP was added at 2 wt% into this base resin, and one group remained without alpha-TCP as control. The adhesives were analyzed for softening in solvent, polymerization kinetics, and degree of conversion (DC). Human teeth naturally affected by caries were submitted to selective removal of carious dentin and were restored with the experimental adhesives. The teeth were evaluated by immediate and long-term (storage in simulated body fluid) tests: microtensile bond strength (mu-TBS), Knoop hardness of dentin, and mineral deposition by microRaman spectroscopy. The experimental adhesive resin with alpha-TCP showed higher initial Knoop hardness than the control group (p 0.05). There was no difference regarding the softening in solvent (p 0.05) and the DC (p > 0.05). The polymerization rate of alpha-TCP group was higher than the control. There was no difference for mu-TBS between groups (p > 0.05). The hardness of CAD increased in 100 and 200 mu m from the adhesive interface after three months (p < 0.05), and both groups indicated higher mineral content on CAD by micro-Raman spectroscopy. The alpha-TCP addition did not affect the dental adhesives' properties and did not change the mineral deposition and mu-TBS.

AB The motion of a group of nonholonomic mobile agents is synchronized using local control laws. This synchronization strategy is inspired by the early flocking model proposed by Reynolds [22] and following work [29, 8]. The control laws presented ensure that all agent headings and speeds converge asymptotically to the same value and collisions between the agents are avoided. The stability of this type of motion is closely related to the connectivity properties of the underlying interconnection graph. Proof techniques are based on LaSalle's invariant principle and algebraic graph theory and the results are verified in numerical simulations.

AB In municipal solid waste disposal public-private-partnership (PPP) projects, economic benefits, as well as social and ecological benefits, are critical in sustaining sustainability development. However, private investors may make more efforts for economic benefits than for social and ecological benefits out of self-interest. Because the government does not have the same information that the investors have, information asymmetry leads to opportunistic behavior. To solve these problems, principal-agent models were established to analyze the incentive mechanism for encouraging investors to adopt a positive attitude toward both economic benefits and social and ecological benefits, inhibiting investors' opportunistic behavior. In particular, numerical simulation was carried out to analyze the relationships between related parameters (c(1), c(2), c(t), a, beta, k, lambda, p). The results show that the investors with higher comprehensive abilities are more willing to make efforts for social and ecological benefits. An increase in incentive and governance intensity would help to encourage investors to make more efforts for project benefits and to lower the level of opportunistic behavior adopted by investors. The complexity of the task and the fuzziness of the perception of effort input results aggravate the uncertainty and risk of the projects due to information asymmetry. Therefore, real-time and positive incentives are important. In order to ensure the social and ecological benefits of a project, performance standards should be set according to the actual situation; investors prefer fixed compensation with lower risk, but fixed compensation does not have incentive effect, and the proportion should not be too high.

AB Social neuroscience has called for new experimental paradigms aimed toward real-time interactions. A distinctive feature of interactions is mutual information exchange: One member of a pair changes in response to the other while simultaneously producing actions that alter the other. Combining mathematical and neurophysiological methods, we introduce a paradigm called the human dynamic clamp (HDC), to directly manipulate the interaction or coupling between a human and a surrogate constructed to behave like a human. Inspired by the dynamic clamp used so productively in cellular neuroscience, the HDC allows a person to interact in real time with a virtual partner itself driven by well-established models of coordination dynamics. People coordinate hand movements with the visually observed movements of a virtual hand, the parameters of which depend on input from the subject's own movements. We demonstrate that HDC can be extended to cover a broad repertoire of human behavior, including rhythmic and discrete movements, adaptation to changes of pacing, and behavioral skill learning as specified by a virtual "teacher." We propose HDC as a general paradigm, best implemented when empirically verified theoretical or mathematical models have been developed in a particular scientific field. The HDC paradigm is powerful because it provides an opportunity to explore parameter ranges and perturbations that are not easily accessible in ordinary human interactions. The HDC not only enables to test the veracity of theoretical models, it also illuminates features that are not always apparent in real-time human social interactions and the brain correlates thereof.

AB This article is concerned with the study of statistical power in agent-based modeling (ABM). After an overview of classic statistics theory on how to interpret Type-II error (whose occurrence is also referred to as a false negative) and power, the manuscript presents a study on ABM simulation articles published in management journals and other outlets likely to publish management and organizational research. Findings show that most studies are underpowered, with some being overpowered. After discussing the risks of under- and overpower, we present two formulas to approximate the number of simulation runs to reach an appropriate level of power. The study concludes with the importance for organizational behavior scholars to perform their models in an attempt to reach a power of 0.95 or higher at the 0.01 significance level.

AB There is a growing body of research showing that people altruistically enforce cooperation norms in social dilemmas. Most of this research analyzes situations where norm violators are known and group members enforce cooperation among each other. However, in many situations norm violators are unknown and detection and punishment is enforced by third parties, such as in plagiarism, tax evasion, doping or even two-timing. Our contribution is threefold. Conceptually, we show the usefulness of inspection game experiments for studying normative behavior in these situations. Methodologically, we present a novel measurement of strategic norm adherence and enforcement, asking for continuous, "frequentistic" choice probabilities. Substantively, we demonstrate that norm adherence in these situations is best understood by coexisting distinct actor types. Self-regarding types learn the inspection rate and calibrate their norm violations to maximize own payoffs. Other-regarding types reciprocate experienced victimizations by stealing from other unknown group members; even at additional costs. We specify both mechanisms by agent-based simulation models and compare their relative explanatory strength by behavioral and attitudinal data in inspection game experiments (N = 220). Our results suggest a modern sociological perspective, which combines homo oeconomicus with homo sociologicus. Further, our findings contribute to understanding conditional norm compliance in broken windows" dynamics, since we show under controlled conditions that such dynamics may result jointly from self- and other regarding mechanisms.

AB Background: Recent studies have identified in Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP), already known as a pathogen in ruminants, a potential zoonotic agent of some autoimmune diseases in humans. Therefore, considering the possible risk for public health, it is necessary a thorough understanding of MAP's gene expression during infection of human host as well as the identification of its immunogenic and/or virulence factors for the development of appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic tools.
   Results: In order to characterize MAP's transcriptome during macrophage infection, we analyzed for the first time the whole gene expression of a human derived strain of MAP in simulated intraphagosomal conditions and after intracellular infection of the human macrophage cell line THP-1 by using the DNA-microarray technology. Results showed that MAP shifts its transcriptome to an adaptive metabolism for an anoxic environment and nutrient starvation. It up-regulates several response factors to oxidative stress or intracellular conditions and allows, in terms of transcription, a passive surface peptidoglycan spoliation within the macrophage along with an intensification of the anabolic activity for lipidic membrane structures.
   Conclusions: These results indicate a possible interactive system between MAP and its host cell based on the internal mimicry unlike other intracellular pathogens, bringing new hypothesis in the virulence and pathogenicity of MAP and its importance in human health.

AB Guiding public opinions toward a pre-set target by informed agents can be a strategy adopted in some practical applications. The informed agents are common agents who are employed or chosen to spread the pre-set opinion. In this work, we propose a social judgment based opinion (SJBO) dynamics model to explore the opinion evolution under the influence of informed agents. The SJBO model distinguishes between inner opinions and observable choices, and incorporates both the compromise between similar opinions and the repulsion between dissimilar opinions. Three choices (support, opposition, and remaining undecided) are considered in the SJBO model. Using the SJBO model, both the inner opinions and the observable choices can be tracked during the opinion evolution process. The simulation results indicate that if the exchanges of inner opinions among agents are not available, the effect of informed agents is mainly dependent on the characteristics of regular agents, including the assimilation threshold, decay threshold, and initial opinions. Increasing the assimilation threshold and decay threshold can improve the guiding effectiveness of informed agents. Moreover, if the initial opinions of regular agents are close to null, the full and unanimous consensus at the pre-set opinion can be realized, indicating that, to maximize the influence of informed agents, the guidance should be started when regular agents have little knowledge about a subject under consideration. If the regular agents have had clear opinions, the full and unanimous consensus at the preset opinion cannot be achieved.

AB Recent evidence regarding a novel functionality of the mirror neuron system (MNS), a so-called 'space mirror mechanism', seems to reinforce the central role of the MNS in social cognition. According to the space mirror hypothesis, neural mirroring accounts for understanding not just what an observed agent is doing, but also the range of potential actions that a suitably located object affords an observed agent in the absence of any motor behaviour. This paper aims to show that the advocate of this space mirror hypothesis faces a crippling dilemma. Either what observed agents can do remains underdetermined by space mirror representations, and no proper understanding of action potentiality is gained; or; if it is just understanding of potential motor acts that is achieved through the sensorimotor representations generated by shared object-related affordances, the very explanatory role of space mirroring is compromised.

ID RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION
AB This article considers the implications of an approach to computer simulation called agent-based modeling for process-oriented analysis. It argues that many theoretical and methodological debates found in the latter field can be effectively advanced by the former. The argument is presented and then extended using a ubiquitous agent-based model proposed to improve understanding of ethnic residential segregation. The argument has three strands. The first is that theoretical and methodological debates are unlikely to progress unless they can be "cashed out" empirically. The second is that agent-based modeling (and its distinctive methodology) has capabilities to do this that existing research methods lack and, in fact, that agent-based models are a natural way to represent "social process" as apparently conceived by process-oriented analysis. The third is that possibilities exist for productive synthesis between agent-based modeling and process-oriented analysis with the former clarifying, instantiating, and perhaps even testing notions of process developed by the latter.

AB Over the past couple of years, a debate has played out in the pages of the American Journal of Community Psychology concerning the relationship between two of Community Psychology's core values: promoting diversity and promoting a sense of community. This special section is to continue a discussion about diversity and community, both among the debate's initial contributors (Alex Stivala, Greg Townley, and Zachary Neal), as well as among others whose own work has touched on these issues (Anne Brodsky, Richard Florida, Jean Hill, and Roderick Watts). In this essay, I address some broad questions that have emerged through this discussion. First, because much has been written on the relationship between diversity and community, both in community psychology and in other disciplines, what do we know, or at least think we know? Second, since the constructs of diversity and sense of community are complex and multi-faceted, how can definitions get in the way and how can we avoid talking past one another in this discussion? Finally, looking across the original papers that initiated this discussion, as well as the contributions in this special section, what path(s) forward do we have?
   Highlights
   There is abundant empirical evidence of a negative association between diversity and cohesion. Definitions of diversity and sense of community vary; clarity is needed. There are multiple ways to confront the tension between diversity and sense of community.

ID COMPLEX NETWORKS; SZNAJD MODEL
AB In the consensus model of Krause-Hegselmann, opinions are real numbers between 0 and 1, and two agents are compatible if the difference of their opinions is smaller than the confidence bound parameter epsilon. A randomly chosen agent takes the average of the opinions of all neighboring agents which are compatible with it. We propose a conjecture, based on numerical evidence, on the value of the consensus threshold epsilon(c) of this model. We claim that epsilon(c) can take only two possible values, depending on the behavior of the average degree d of the graph representing the social relationships, when the population N approaches infinity: if d diverges when N -> infinity, epsilon(c) equals the consensus threshold epsilon(i) similar to 0.2 on the complete graph; if instead d stays finite when N -> infinity, epsilon(c) = 1/2 as for the model of Deffuant et al.

AB Calf diarrhea is a major economic burden to the bovine industry. Since multiple infectious agents can be involved in calf diarrhea, and the detection of each of the causative agents by traditional methods is laborious and expensive, a panel of 2 multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays was developed for rapid and simultaneous detection of the 5 major bovine enteric pathogens (i.e., Bovine coronavirus [BCoV; formally known as Betacoronavirus I], group A Bovine rotavirus [BRV], Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli K99(+), and Cryptosporidium parvum). The estimated detection limit (i.e., analytic sensitivity) of the panel was 0.1 TCID50 (50% tissue culture infective dose) for BCoV and group A BRV; 5 and 0.5 colony-forming units for E. colt K99(+) and Salmonella, respectively; and 50 oocysts for Cryptosporidium per reaction. In testing 243 fecal samples obtained from submissions to the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory or from experimental animals with known infection status, the newly developed multiplex real-time PCR panel simultaneously detected all 5 pathogens directly from fecal samples and was more rapid and sensitive than the traditional diagnostic tests. The PCR panel showed 89%-97% agreement with those conventional diagnostic tests, demonstrating diagnostic sensitivity equal to or better than that of the conventional tests. In conclusion, the multiplex real-time PCR panel can be a tool for a timely and accurate diagnosis of calf diarrhea associated with BCoV, group A BRV, E. coli K99(+), Salmonella, and/or Cryptosporidium.

AB The crystal growth morphologies of manganese carbohydrazide perchlorate, iron carbohydrazide perchlorate, cobalt carbohydrazide perchlorate, nickel carbohydrazide perchlorate and cadmium carbohydrazide perchlorate were investigated by Bravais-Freidel-Donnay-Harker (BFDH) and growth morphology method. The results show that the crystal morphologies of them are close to oblong block shapes, and the growth on (101) and (002) faces are the most important growth direction because of the minimum relative growth rates. According to the cleaved main growth faces, it can be inferred that crystal-control reagents with the active hydrogen atoms in the functional groups can effectively control the crystal morphology for them. In addition, the experimental morphologies of them were synthesized and observed by a coldfield-emission scanning electron microscope. It is concluded that AE model are nearer to experimental morphology, and more reliable to predict crystal morphologies for carbohydrazide perchlorates.

AB The successful adoption of innovations depends on the provision of adequate information to farmers. In rural areas of developing countries, farmers usually rely on their social networks as an information source. Hence, policy-makers and program-implementers can benefit fromsocial diffusion processes to effectively disseminate information. This study aims to identify the set of farmers who initially obtain information ('seeds') that optimises diffusion through the network. It systematically evaluates different criteria for seed selection, number of seeds, and their interaction effects. An empirical Agent-Based Model adjusted to a case study in rural Zambia was applied to predict diffusion outcomes for varying seed sets ex ante. Simulations revealed that informing farmers with the most connections leads to highest diffusion speed and reach. Also targeting village heads and farmers with high betweenness centrality, who function as bridges connecting different parts of the network, enhances diffusion. An increased number of seeds improves reach, but the marginal effects of additional seeds decline. Interdependencies between seed set size and selection criteria highlight the importance of considering both seed selection criteria and seed set size for optimising seeding strategies to enhance information diffusion.

AB The characteristics of biological tissues are determined by the interactions of large numbers of autonomous cells. These interactions can be mediated remotely by diffusive biochemical factors, or by direct cell-cell contact. E-cadherin is a protein expressed on the surface of normal epithelial cells that plays a key role in mediating intercellular adhesion via calcium-dependent homotypic interactions. E-cadherin is a metastasis-suppressor protein and its loss of function is associated with malignant progression.
   The purpose of this study was to apply an agent-based simulation paradigm in order to examine the emergent growth properties of mixed populations consisting of normal and E-cadherin defective cells in monolayer cell culture. Specifically, we have investigated the dynamics of normal cell:cell interactions in terms of intercellular adhesion and migration, and have used a simplified rule to represent the concepts of juxtacrine epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation and subsequent effect on cell proliferation. This cellular level control determines the overall population growth in a simulated experiment.
   Our approach provides a tool for modelling the development of defined biological abnormalities in epithelial and other biological tissues, raising novel predictions for future experimental testing. The results predict that even a relatively small number of abnormal ('anti-social') cells can modify the rate of the total population expansion, but the magnitude of this effect also depends on the extrinsic (culture) environment. In addition to directly influencing population dynamics, 'anti-social' cells can also disrupt the behaviour of the normal cells around them. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: People increasingly desire tooth whitening. Considering the wide range of whitening products on the market, this study evaluated the efficacy of whitening toothpastes and mouth rinses compared with the 10% carbamide peroxide (CP) whitening gel.
   Methods: We obtained 120 cylindrical specimens from bovine teeth, which were darkened for 24 hours in a coffee solution. The color measurement was performed by a spectrophotometer using the CIE L*a*b* system, and specimens were divided into six groups according to the use of the following agents: group 1, conventional fluoridated toothpaste; group 2, Close Up White Now; group 3, Listerine Whitening; group 4, Colgate Plax Whitening; group 5, experimental mouth rinse with Plasdone; and group 6, 10% CP Whiteness Perfect. After the simulation of 12 weeks of treatment for groups 1 to 5 and 14 days of treatment for group 6, the specimens were subjected to a new color reading.
   Results: Data were subjected to one-way analysis of variance (alpha=0.05), which showed significant differences among groups after 12 weeks for Delta E (p=0.001). Results of the Tukey test revealed that groups 3, 4, and 6 presented significantly higher color alteration than groups 1, 2, and 5.
   Conclusions: The whitening toothpaste Close Up White Now and the experimental mouth rinse with Plasdone showed similar color alteration as conventional toothpaste after a 12-week treatment simulation. These groups presented significantly lower color alteration compared with whitening mouth rinses Listerine and Colgate Plax Whitening, which showed similar results to those observed after 14 days of bleaching with 10% CP treatment.

AB The Prisoner's Dilemma is a typical structure of interaction in human societies. In spite of a long tradition dealing with the matter from different perspectives, the emergence of cooperation or defection still remains a controversial issue from both an empirical and a theoretical point of view. In this paper we propose a local interaction model with endogenous network formation, in the attempt to provide a reasonable account of emerging behaviors. A population of boundedly rational agents repeatedly chooses to cooperate or defect. Each agent's action affects only her interacting mates, according to a network of relationships. Agents are randomly given the possibility to substitute undesired mates with unknown ones. Full cooperation, full defection and coexistence of both cooperation and defection in homogeneous clusters are possible outcomes of the model. Computer-based simulations are applied to investigate under what circumstances either case is most likely. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID AGENT-BASED SIMULATION; DEMAND
AB Parking is a major constraint for car users and therefore an important factor in mode choice decisions. In this paper we introduce a model to simulate parking search behavior for cars within a multiagent transport simulation, including full simulation of all steps of parking search, such as walking to and from the vehicle. This is combined with the capabilities of privately owned autonomous vehicles (AVs), which may park automatically, often in other locations than conventional cars, once they are not in use. Three different strategies for AVs to park are developed: (1) Conventional parking search, (2) parking at a designated AV lot, and (3) empty cruising, where vehicles do not use any parking space, but keep on driving. We apply the simulation model to a residential neighborhood in central Berlin, where parking pressure is generally high and apply different shares of AV usage to the synthetic population used. This allows a detailed evaluation of effects for both AV and conventional vehicle owners. Results suggest that the usage of designated parking lots may be the most beneficial solution for most users, with both vehicle wait times and parking search durations being the lowest.

AB Researchers have begun developing simulation models as a cost-effective and expeditious means to explore and enhance our understanding of energy use behavior interventions. These models have provided unique insights into potential energy savings as a result of improved occupant behavior, but have not yet reached the capability to be used for predictive modeling purposes. Therefore, this paper attempts to build on previous modeling efforts and develops an empirically and conceptually grounded occupant behavior model for simulating normative feedback interventions based on literature from the social science and field data. This model is then used to conduct "what if" analyses testing three novel normative feedback intervention strategies and the effect of social network structure on intervention outcomes. The most successful and immediately applicable strategy consists of sending normative feedback only to individuals who use more energy than the group norm. This strategy resulted in a mean energy use reduction of 1.4 kW h per week per occupant, 2.2%, relative to traditional individual and normative feedback strategies used today. Lastly, it was found that the social network structure in which the interventions took place affected the absolute outcomes (i.e., net change) of the simulations but not the relative outcomes (i.e., strategy ranking).

AB Polyethylene foams, which account for a large share of the total production of thermoplastic foams, are mainly produced through the extrusion foaming process with butane as the blowing agent. Drawbacks exist in terms of the safety hazards of the blowing agent as well as the aging requirement for eliminating residual butane prior to shipping to customers, which usually takes 1-2 weeks and poses significant cost and logistical challenges. Eliminating the safety risks and reducing the aging time are the major challenges facing the industry. In this work, CO2 is used as an inert gas to blend with isobutane (i-C4H10) in the foaming process to dilute the concentration of i-C4H10 and hence eliminate the safety risks. The solubility of pure gas and gas mixtures in low-density polyethylene (LDPE) was measured under experimental foaming conditions, and the diffusivity of pure gas and gas mixture in LDPE was clarified by desorption experiments. Subsequently, the foaming behavior of LDPE with CO2 + i-C4H10 mixtures was studied, and the shrinkage behavior of the LDPE foams was investigated by means of experimental analysis and numerical simulation of dimensional stability. The results showed that unlike the LDPE foams blown with CO2 that present severe shrinkage and poor appearance, the LDPE foams blown with the CO2 + i-C4H10 mixture exhibited much better dimensional stability. Moreover, the addition of more than 36 wt % i-C4H10 to the blowing agent mixture in the foaming experiment could not only facilitate the controllable preparation of cell morphology but also effectively solve the shrinkage problem of LDPE foams.

AB Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are gaining attention as substitutes for antibiotics in order to combat the risk posed by multi-drug resistant pathogens. Several research groups are engaged in design of potent anti-infective agents using natural AMPs as templates. In this study, a library of peptides with high sequence similarity to Myeloid Antimicrobial Peptide (MAP) family were screened using popular online prediction algorithms. These peptide variants were designed in a manner to retain the conserved residues within the MAP family. The prediction algorithms were found to effectively classify peptides based on their antimicrobial nature. In order to improve the activity of the identified peptides, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, using bilayer and micellar systems could be used to design and predict effect of residue substitution on membranes of microbial and mammalian cells. The inference from MD simulation studies well corroborated with the wet-lab observations indicating that MD-guided rational design could lead to discovery of potent AMPs. The effect of the residue substitution on membrane activity was studied in greater detail using killing kinetic analysis. Killing kinetics studies on Gram-positive, negative and human erythrocytes indicated that a single residue change has a drastic effect on the potency of AMPs. An interesting outcome was a switch from monophasic to biphasic death rate constant of Staphylococcus aureus due to a single residue mutation in the peptide.

AB By combining numerical simulation and experimental investigation, this paper intensively investigated the influence rules of adding three active agents (SiO2, TiO2 and NaF) on the dynamic behaviors of flow field in the laser welding 304 stainless steel thick plate pool. First of all, the mathematical model of the activating laser welding stainless steel thick plate was constructed to numerically investigate the impact of active agents on the fluid flow in the pool. Secondly, based on the tungsten particle tracing principle test, the high speed camera system was adopted for real-time monitoring to investigate the mechanism of action of the active agents on the flow field in the pool. The results suggested that, the active agents partially affected the mode of fluid flow. The velocity vector from both sides of the pool to the center occurred on the pool surface, while vortex from the pool margin to the center occurred on the pool cross section. The phenomenon that the tracing tungsten particles moving from the pool margin to the center, it shows that the flow direction of the fluid changed after coating with the active agent, the fluid flew from the pool margin to the center. At the same time, the coating of active agents changed the flow velocity of fluid inside the pool, and SiO2 active agent has the most significant increase effect, the maximum velocity of fluid flow on the upper surface, the longitudinal and cross sections at the same position of the SiO2 active agent coated specimen increased by 25.8%, 8% and 33.8%, respectively, compared with that without the active agents.

AB The causes of socioeconomic inequality have been debated since the time of Plato. Many reasons for the development of stratification have been proposed, from the need for hierarchical control over large-scale irrigation systems to the accumulation of small differences in wealth over time via inheritance processes. However, none of these explains how unequal societies came to completely displace egalitarian cultural norms over time. Our study models demographic consequences associated with the unequal distribution of resources in stratified societies. Agent-based simulation results show that in constant environments, unequal access to resources can be demographically destabilizing, resulting in the outward migration and spread of such societies even when population size is relatively small. In variable environments, stratified societies spread more and are also better able to survive resource shortages by sequestering mortality in the lower classes. The predictions of our simulation are provided modest support by a range of existing empirical studies. In short, the fact that stratified societies today vastly outnumber egalitarian societies may not be due to the transformation of egalitarian norms and structures, but may instead reflect the more rapid migration of stratified societies and consequent conquest or displacement of egalitarian societies over time.

AB Allosteric enzymes control reaction rates in biochemical reactions. The catalytic activity of allosteric enzymes depends on the concentration of a certain regulating compound. A simgoidal saturation curve is a characteristic of the enzymes that exert allosteric control of reaction rates. These enzymes are rather large enzymatic complexes usually composed of at least one catalytic subunit and a regulatory fraction, and the complex catalytic activity is given by the cooperative interactions between those enzymatic subunits. Realistic simulation of biocatalytic allosteric phenomena requires an appropiate modelling of the enzyme kinetic behavior. Modelling enzymes with cooperative kinetics can be achieved by defining interacting agents. Agent-based modelling allows an accurate representation of sigmoidal saturation curves, without the kinetic parameters that are needed in other kinetic models. Experimental data from Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamylase are compared to theoretical results from different models for allosteric systems. Results from agent-based modelling show a good agreement with experimental saturation curves.

In general, the former allows the introduction of elements of novelty, while the latter is responsible for the motion of a system in its phase space. Often, these processes are strongly related, since an innovation can trigger the evolution, and the latter can provide the optimal conditions for the emergence of innovations. Both processes can be studied by using the framework of evolutionary game theory, where evolution constitutes an intrinsic mechanism. At the same time, the concept of innovation requires an opportune mathematical representation. Notably, innovation can be modeled as a strategy, or it can constitute the underlying mechanism that allows agents to change strategy. Here, we analyze the second case, investigating the behavior of a heterogeneous population, composed of imitative and innovative agents. Imitative agents change strategy only by imitating that of their neighbors, whereas innovative ones change strategy without the need for a copying source. The proposed model is analyzed by means of analytical calculations and numerical simulations in different topologies. Remarkably, results indicate that the mixing of mechanisms can be detrimental to cooperation near phase transitions. In those regions, the spatial reciprocity from imitative mechanisms is destroyed by innovative agents, leading to the downfall of cooperation. Our investigation sheds some light on the complex dynamics emerging from the heterogeneity of strategy revision methods, highlighting the role of innovation in evolutionary games.

AB Carsharing companies can customize their service by adopting different pricing schemes and offers with the goal of increasing service attractivity, fleet usage and profits. Dynamic pricing strategies can be designed to adjust and balance cars' availability temporally and spatially; they may pose some questions regarding customer equity, since such measures could impact their activities and mode choice. In this paper, we develop an experimental design for conducting an explorative analysis of how availability-based and time-based dynamic pricing schemes impact demand and supply performances. The strategy is simulated in the open-source agent-based software MATSim and compared to a fixed pricing policy scheme. Two spatial distributions of the value of time for the population of Berlin are applied (radially and coaxially) to systematically analyze agents' behavior response to these pricing policies. Results confirm that when dynamic pricing is applied people with low value of time tend to abandon the carsharing mode in favor of other modes of transportation. Overall, the strategy applied in this study appears to be unfair, since it hinders low income groups from using the carsharing service.

AB The process of online reinforcement learning also creates a stream of experiences that an agent can store to re-learn from them. In this work, we introduce a concept of artificial perception affecting the dynamics of experience memory replay, which induces a secondary goal-directed drive that complements the main goal defined by the reinforcement function. The different perception dynamics are capable of inducing different "personality" types able to govern the agent behavior, possibly enabling it to exhibit an improved performance over an environment with specific characteristics. Experimental results show that different personalities show different performance levels when facing environment variations, therefore, showcasing the influence of artificial perception in agent's adaptation.

AB Sorting garbage and recycling renewable resources is a new and effective means to address the "garbage siege." To examine residents' classification behaviors and scientifically assess effects of policies, this study comprehensively analyzes factors influencing residents' classification behavior at the government, resident and societal dimensions and construct multiagent decision-making functions and an interaction model by Anylogic platform. The empirical results show publicity and education have the most significant impacts on classification behavior followed by classification infrastructure and subjective norms. The simulation results show publicity and education, charging policies and government subsidies significantly transform unclassified residents into classified residents and all three approaches double rates of classification behavior. From perspectives of multisubject interaction and multicenter governance, this study analyzes motivations behind classification behavior from a micro level and quantifies effects of policies from a macro level, providing a common research method and paradigm that can be used in behavior research and policy formulation.

ID REPUTATION
AB We present an adaptive decentralized trust formalization well suited for electronic commerce. Our model, called zTrust, constitutes two essential elements. The first is the adviser modeling mechanism that enables consumer agents to merge the cognitive and the probabilistic views of trust and adaptively calculate the trustworthiness of advisers according to environmental conditions, information availability, and participants' behavioral dispositions. Using this mechanism, consumers are able to form their social network consisting of the most reliable advisers. The second element is a trust-oriented service selection framework that models the qualification and trustworthiness of providers in delivering the multiattribute products and adopts a procurement auction model to choose the most pertinent provider that meets a consumer's quality of service requirements. We give a formal description of our approach and validate it with simulations demonstrating that our solution yields high-quality results under various realistic conditions. Experimental results indicate that the zTrust model can be effectively employed in dynamic agent-oriented e-commerce applications.

AB This review describes a body of work on computational immune systems that behave analogously to the natural immune system. These artificial immune systems (AIS) simulate the behavior of the natural immune system and in some cases have been used to solve practical engineering problems such as computer security. AIS have several strengths that can complement wet lab immunology. It is easier to conduct simulation experiments and to vary experimental conditions, for example, to rule out hypotheses; it is easier to isolate a single mechanism to test hypotheses about how it functions; agent-based models of the immune system can integrate data from several different experiments into a single in silico experimental system.

AB In this paper, we monitor the in vitro tissue clearing process of mouse dorsal skin immersed into two types of agents using Mueller matrix microscope. By Mueller matrix polar decomposition, we can see that the major difference between polarization changes due to two kinds of agents is the opposite trend of phase retardance with clearing. For the insight of the connection between different agents with the niicrostructural and optical changes of cleared tissues, we establish various models to mimic the dynamic process of microphysical features of tissues with clearing time. The mechanisms considered include refractive index matching. collagen shrinkage, more orderly fibers and birefringence variation. We compare the experimental results with simulations based on a single mechanism model and a combined model, respectively, which confirms that an individual possible mechanism cannot explain the polarization phenomena due to clearing. Also by simulations of various clearing models involving two possible mechanisms, We can speculate that formamide and saturated sucrose as agents have respective impacts on tissue features and then cause different polarization changes With clearing. Specifically, collagen shrinkage plus birefringence reduction can better explain the tissue cleared by formamide, and refractive index match plus increased birefringence model is likely to be a proper description of tissue cleared by sucrose. Both simulations and experiments also validate the potential of Mueller matrix microscope as a good tool to understand the interaction between clearing agents and tissues.

AB This project applies agent-based modeling (ABM) techniques to better understand the operation, organization, and structure of a local heroin market. The simulation detailed was developed using data from an 18-month ethnographic case study. The original research, collected in Denver, CO during the 1990s, represents the historic account of users and dealers who operated in the Larimer area heroin market. Working together, the authors studied the behaviors of customers, private dealers, street-sellers, brokers, and the police, reflecting the core elements pertaining to how the market operated. After evaluating the logical consistency between the data and agent behaviors, simulations scaled-up interactions to observe their aggregated outcomes. While the concept and findings from this study remain experimental, these methods represent a novel way in which to understand illicit drug markets and the dynamic adaptations and outcomes they generate. Extensions of this research perspective, as well as its strengths and limitations, are discussed.

AB A theory of communication between autonomous agents should make testable predictions about which communicative behaviors are collaborative, and provide a framework for determining the features of a communicative situation that affect whether a behavior is collaborative. The results presented here are derived from a two-phase empirical method. First, we analyze a corpus of naturally occurring problem-solving dialogues in order to identify potentially collaborative communicative strategies. Second, we experimentally test hypotheses that arise from the corpus analysis in Design-World, an experimental environment for simulating dialogues. The results indicate that collaborative behaviors must be defined relative to the cognitive limitations of the agents and the cognitive demands of the task. The method of computational simulation provides an additional empirical basis for theories of human-computer collaboration.

AB The exposure and diffusion of energy consumption information in building occupant peer networks has been shown to influence an individual's energy consumption decisions. In this paper, we develop an agent-based computational model for individual energy consumption behavior based on data collected during an experiment on residential energy use. We simulate the building occupants' decision making and the information transmission process. By comparing the impact of several parameters in the network level computational model and validating the parameters in a second experimental setting, our research serves to clarify how network relations can be leveraged for modifying energy consumption behavior. Network degree and weight were identified as the major structural parameters that impact building occupants' conservation decisions, while network size was found to have no significant impact. These findings have important implications for the design and effectiveness of residential energy feedback systems designed to promote energy conservation in residential buildings.

AB The ability to form groups to overcome problems has been crucial for the evolution of human beings. To favour the formation of cooperating groups, one of the mechanisms developed is the inter-group bias, namely the tendency of individuals to favour members of their group and hinder the external ones. It is the cognitive equivalent of the "green beard effect" in evolutionary biology, introduced by Hamilton and popularized by Dawkins, for which a group can profit of the altruistic behaviour of its members. Here, we use a behavioural model based on the Ultimatum Game, to shed light on how this behaviour cloud has been stabilized in the human population, estimating the magnitude of favouritism needed to overcome selfish individuals. Through both numerical simulations and analytic approaches, we study how a community of collectivist and individualist agents evolves. The key factor is the mechanism for the evolution of the population, i.e., the replacement of the poor-performing individuals. In the case of replacement by the reproduction of existing individuals, we observe a smooth phase transition and no coexistence. If the replacement is random, the transition smooths, and coexistence is possible. We developed analytical approaches for these two cases and performed numerical simulations. Although analytical calculations support the behaviour emerging from simulations, some differences ask for more refined treatments.

TI Cooperative behavior in evolutionary snowdrift games with the
   unconditional imitation rule on regular lattices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
LA English
DT Article
ID PRISONERS-DILEMMA; SOCIAL DILEMMAS; NETWORKS
AB We study an evolutionary snowdrift game with the unconditional imitation updating rule on regular lattices. Detailed numerical simulations establish the structure of plateaus and discontinuous jumps of the equilibrium cooperation frequency f(c) as a function of the cost-to-benefit ratio r. By analyzing the stability of local configurations, it is found that the transitions occur at values of r at which there are changes in the ranking of the payoffs to the different local configurations of agents using different strategies. Nonmonotonic behavior of f(c)(r) at the intermediate range of r is analyzed in terms of the formation of blocks of agents using the cooperative strategy that are stabilized by agents inside the block due to the updating rule. For random initial condition with 50%-50% agents of different strategies randomly dispersed, cooperation persists in the whole range of r and the level of cooperation is higher than that in the well-mixed case in a wide range of r. These results are in sharp contrast to those based on the replicator updating rule. The sensitivity to initial states with different fractions of cooperative agents is also discussed. The results serve to illustrate that both the spatial structure and the updating rule are important in determining the level of cooperation in a competing population. When extreme initial states are used where there are very few agents of a strategy in a background of the opposite strategy, the result would depend on the stability of the clusters formed by the initially minority agents.

AB We investigate the problem of controlling a group of mobile agents in a plane in order to move them towards a desired orbit via pinning control, in which each agent is associated with a chaotic oscillator coupled with those of neighboring agents, and the pinning strategy is to have the common linear feedback acting on a small fraction of agents by random selection. We explore the effects of the pinning probability, feedback gains and agent density in the pinning synchronization of a mobile agent network under a fast-switching constraint, and perform numerical simulations for validation. In particular, we show that there exists a critical pinning density for network synchronization with an unbounded region: above the threshold, the dynamical network can be controlled by pinning; below it, anarchy prevails. And for the network with a single bounded synchronization region, pinning control has little effect as regards enhancing network synchronizability.

AB Forest Transition Theory (FTT) suggests that reforestation may follow deforestation as a result of and interplay between changing social, economic and ecological conditions. We develop a simplistic but empirically data driven land use transition agent-based modeling platform, interactive land use transition agent-based model (ILUTABM), that is able to reproduce the observed land use patterns and link the forest transition to parcel-level heuristic-based land use decisions and ecosystem service (ES). The ILUTABM endogenously links landowners' land use decisions with ecosystem services (ES) provided by the lands by treating both lands and landowners as interacting agents. The ILUTABM simulates both the land use changes resulting from farmers' decision behaviors as well as the recursive effects of changing land uses on farmers' decision behaviors. The ILUTABM is calibrated and validated at 30 m x 30 m spatial resolution using National Land Cover Data (NLCD) 1992, 2001 and 2006 across the western Missisquoi watershed, which is located in the north-eastern US with an estimated area of 283 square kilometers and 312 farmers farming on 16% of the total Missisquoi watershed area. This study hypothesizes that farmers' land use decisions are made primarily based on their summed expected utilities and that impacts of exogenous socio-economic factors, such as natural disasters, public policies and institutional/social reforms, on farmers' expected utilities can significantly influence the land use transitions between agricultural and forested lands. Monte Carlo experiments under six various socio-economic conditions combined with different ES valuation schemes are used to assess the sensitivities of the ILUTABM. Goodness-of-fit measures confirm that the ILUTABM is able to reproduce 62% of the observed land use transitions. However, the spatial patterns of the observed land used transitions are more clustered than the simulated counterparts. We find that, when farmers value food provisioning Ecosystem Services (ES) more than other ES (e.g., soil and water regulation), deforestation is observed. However, when farmers value less food provisioning than other ES or they value food provisioning and other ES equally, the forest transition is observed. The ILUTABM advances the Forest Transition Theory (FTT) framework by endogenizing the interactions of socio-ecological feedbacks and socio-economic factors in a generalizable model that can be calibrated with empirical data.

AB Peptide YY (PYY) is a 36 amino acid peptide that is released from the endocrine cells of the distal ileum, colon, and rectum following a meal. PYY is strongly proabsorptive in the small intestine. We studied the effects of intravenous PYY on colonic water and electrolyte transport in awake dogs. Dogs had 20 cm neurovascularly intact colon Thiry-Vella fistulas (TVF) surgically constructed. Colonic transport was studied in three experimental groups. Group 1 animals received a standard mixed meal. Group 2 animals were unfed and received intravenous PYY at 100 pmol/kg/hr for two hours. This dose of PYY has previously been shown to simulate the plasma levels of PYY normally seen after a meal. Group 3 received intravenous PYY at the same dose in addition to a mixed meal. Our study shows an increase in colonic water, Na+, and Cl- absorption after a meal (P < 0.05). Infusion of PYY at a 100 pmol/kg/hr was significantly proabsorptive beginning at 60 minutes (P < 0.01). Infusion of PYY in addition to a meal further increased absorption (P < 0.05). PYY is a potent proabsorptive agent in the colon of the conscious dog. PYY, or its analogs, may be useful clinical agents in intestinal. malabsorptive disorders or after bowel resection.

AB Evolutionary game theory has been a powerful tool to understand the ubiquity of cooperation in many real-world systems which ranges from biological to economical and social sciences. In this paper, we propose a novel game model, which considers different fitness evaluation means for focal agent and his randomly chosen neighbor, to characterize the asymmetry of information during the game playing. When playing the game, the focal agent obtains its own fitness which includes its own payoff and the average payoff of his neighbors. However, due to the limited information for the chosen neighbor, his fitness can not be evaluated as the focal agent but just the traditional way, namely his fitness equals to his payoff. Large-scale numerical simulations indicate that this kind of asymmetric fitness computation can have substantial effects on the cooperative behaviors on the regular lattice. Interestingly, the larger the asymmetric factor alpha, the higher the cooperation level rho(C). Meanwhile, introducing the asymmetric fitness evaluation can induce the cooperative clusters to become larger and larger as alpha increases. The phase space between b and alpha can be enlarged, and thereby the ranges for cooperators to survive in the sea of defectors can be widely extended. Our findings can greatly be conducive to interpret the emergence of cooperation within the population. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Advances in multiagent simulation techniques(1-3) have made possible the study of realistic highway traffic patterns and have allowed theories(3-6) based on driver behaviour to be tested. Such simulations display various empirical features of traffic flows(7), and are used to design traffic controls that maximize the throughput of vehicles on busy highways. In addition to its intrinsic economic values, vehicular traffic is of interest because it may be relevant to social phenomena in which diverse individuals compete with each other under certain constraintsg(9,10). Here we report simulations of heterogeneous traffic which demonstrate that cooperative, coherent states can arise from competitive interactions between vehicles. As the density of vehicles increases, their interactions cause a transition into a highly correlated state in which all vehicles move with approximately the same speed, analogous to the motion of a solid block. This state is safer because it has a reduced lane-changing rate, and the traffic flow is high and stable. The coherent state disappears when the vehicle density exceeds a critical value. We observe the effect also in real Dutch traffic data.

AB Co-continuous SiC ceramic composites using pure aluminum, epoxy, and polyurethane (PU) as ductile agents were developed. The dynamic mechanical behavior and failure mechanisms were investigated experimentally using the split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) method and computationally by finite element (FE) simulations. The results show that the SiC3D/Al composite has the best overall performance in comparison with SiC3D/epoxy and SiC3D/PU composites. FE simulations are generally consistent with experimental data. These simulations provide valuable help in predicting mechanical strength and in interpreting the experimental results and failure mechanisms. They may be combined with micrographs for fracture characterizations of the composites. We found that interactions between the SiC phase and ductile agents under dynamic compression in the SHPB method are complex, and that interfacial condition is an important parameter that determines the mechanical response of SiC3D composites with a characteristic interlocking structure during dynamic compression. However, the effect of the mechanical properties of ductile agents on dynamic behavior of the composites is a second consideration in the production of the composites.

AB Background: The administration of uterotonic agents during cesarean delivery is highly variable. The authors hypothesized a rule of threes algorithm, featuring oxytocin 3 IU, timed uterine tone evaluations, and a systematic approach to alternative uterotonic agents, would reduce the oxytocin dose required to obtain adequate uterine tone.
   Methods: Sixty women undergoing elective cesarean delivery were randomized to receive a low-dose bolus or continuous infusion of oxytocin. To blind participants, the rule group simultaneously received intravenous oxytocin (3 IU/3 ml) and a wide-open infusion of 0.9% normal saline (500 ml); the standard care group received intravenous 0.9% normal saline (3 ml) and a wide-open infusion of oxytocin (30 IU in 0.9% normal saline/500 ml). Uterine tone was assessed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 min, and if inadequate, additional uterotonic agents were administered. Uterine tone, total dose and timing of uterotonic agent use, maternal hemodynamics, side effects, and blood loss were recorded.
   Results: Adequate uterine tone was achieved with lower oxytocin doses in the rule versus standard care group (mean, 4.0 vs. 8.4 IU; point estimate of the difference, 4.4 1.0 IU; 95% CI, 2.60 to 6.15; P < 0.0001). No additional oxytocin or alternative uterotonic agents were needed in either group after 6 min. No differences in the uterine tone, maternal hemodynamics, side effects, or blood loss were observed.
   Conclusion: A rule of threes algorithm using oxytocin 3 IU results in lower oxytocin doses when compared with continuous-infusion oxytocin in women undergoing elective cesarean delivery.

AB The capacity of hydroxyl ions when used as a nucleating agent to form apatite in simulated body fluid (SBF) was investigated. A 25 wt% poly(e-caprolactone) solution was prepared using 1,1,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol as a solvent and was electrospun under an electric field of 1 kV/cm. Subsequently, non-woven poly(epsilon-caprolactone) fabrics were dipped into 4 M NaOH solution and the experimental group was then directly air-dried (NaOH coated), while the control group was washed with deionized water and air-dried (NaOH treated) under ambient conditions. The non-woven poly(epsilon-caprolactone) fabrics that were coated and treated with NaOH were exposed to SBF for 1 week, which resulted in the deposition of a layer of apatite crystals on the non-woven poly(epsilon-caprolactone) fabric coated with NaOH only. On the other hand, when the non-woven poly(epsilon-caprolactone) fabrics were dipped into 0.05, 0.1, 1 and 4 M NaOH solutions, respectively, air-dried, and then soaked in SBF, the apatite forming capacity was gradually increased according to the concentration of NaOH solution. These results were explained in terms of the degree of apatite supersaturation in SBF induced by the release of hydroxyl ions from the coated NaOH because hydroxyl ions are one of the constituent elements of apatite. These results suggest that hydroxyl ions have a good potential for use as a nucleating agent for apatite on a previously non-bioactive polymer surface. (C) Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2011

DE Opinion formation; Social interaction; Investor sentiment
ID STOCK-MARKET
AB We use weekly survey data on short-term and medium-term sentiment of German investors to estimate the parameters of a stochastic model of opinion formation governed by social interactions. The bivariate nature of our data set also allows us to explore the interaction between the two hypothesized opinion formation processes, while consideration of the simultaneous weekly changes of the stock index DAX enables us to study the influence of sentiment on returns. Technically, we extend the maximum likelihood framework for parameter estimation in agent-based models introduced by Lux (2009a) by generalizing it to bivariate and tri-variate settings. As it turns out, our results are consistent with strong social interaction in short-run sentiment. While one observes abrupt changes of mood in short-run sentiment, medium-term sentiment is a more slowly moving process in which the influence of social interaction seems to be less pronounced. The tri-variate model entails a significant effect from short-run sentiment on prices in-sample, but its out-of-sample predictive performance does not beat the random walk benchmark.

AB The paper presents first steps in a project that aims at exploring new modelling and simulation tools (e.g. the ones offered by the Cellular Automata approach) in order to study complex systems and phenomena concerning the economic and social contexts. The specific problem we are presenting in this paper concerns the complex dynamics involved in an asset price model with heterogeneous agents. The dynamics of the global asset market can be studied as a result of local interactions that emerges from the autonomous entities that are involved in the market system. The proposed model allows to describe in a unified way both global and local interactions that characterize economic agents involved in financial market trading. Even if experimental work is still ongoing, first performed steps have allowed us to gather some significant results that allowed us to verify the suitability of the proposed approach.

AB Exploring the scientific impact of online big-data has attracted much attention of researchers from different fields in recent years. Complex financial systems are typical open systems profoundly influenced by the external information. Based on the large-scale data in the public media and stock markets, we first define an information driving force, and analyze how it affects the complex financial system. The information driving force is observed to be asymmetric in the bull and bear market states. As an application, we then propose an agent-based model driven by the information driving force. Especially, all the key parameters are determined from the empirical analysis rather than from statistical fitting of the simulation results. With our model, both the stationary properties and non-stationary dynamic behaviors are simulated. Considering the mean-field effect of the external information, we also propose a few-body model to simulate the financial market in the laboratory. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Building design involves many challenges and requires to take into account the interaction between the building and the users. Different occupant behaviour models implemented with building simulation tools (thermal, air quality, lighting) have been proposed. Among these, models based on the agent approach seem to be the most promising. However, existing models poorly describe human cognition and the social dimension. Moreover, they are often oriented towards a specific use (thermal simulation, waste management) without being transposable to another field, and they require a significant instantiation effort for each new case, making their use difficult. This article proposes an agent-based model called Li-BIM that simulates the behaviour of the occupants in a building and their indoor comfort. Li-BIM model is structured around the numerical modelling of the building -BIM- (with standard exchange format IFC), a high-resolution cognitive model, and the coupling with various physical models. Li-BIM simulates the reactive, deliberative and social behaviour of occupants in residential dwellings based on the Belief Desire Intention architecture. This model, thanks its ease of use and flexibility, is an operational and relevant tool to support building design process with a human-centred approach. An application of the model is presented, focusing on energy consumption and the inhabitants' comfort. In-situ data obtained from the instrumented house that served as case study have been compared with simulation results from Li-BIM and a standard energy simulation software, demonstrating the reliability of the proposed model.

AB Aim: To determine whether extracellular or intravascular contrast agents could detect chronic scarred myocardium in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods: Eighteen pigs underwent a 4 week ligation of 1 or 2 diagonal coronary arteries to induce chronic myocardial infarction. The hearts were then removed and perfused in a Langendorff apparatus. Eighteen hearts were divided into 2 groups. The hearts in groups I (n=9) and II (n=9) received the bolus injection of Gadolinium diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA, 0.05 mmol/kg) and gadolinium-based macromolecular agent (P792, 15 mu mol/kg), respectively. First pass T-2(*) MRI was acquired using a FLASH sequence. Delayed enhancement T-1 MRI was acquired with an inversion recovery prepared TurboFLASH sequence. Results: Wash-in of both agents resulted in a sharp and dramatic T-2(*) signal loss of scarred myocardium similar to that of normal myocardium. The magnitude and velocity of T-2(*) signal recovery caused by wash-out of extracellular agents in normal myocardium was significantly less than that in scarred myocardium. Conversely, the T-2* signal of scarred and normal myocardium recovered to plateau rapidly and simultaneously due to wash-out of intravascular agents. At the following equilibrium, extracellular agent-enhanced T-1 signal intensity was significantly greater in scarred myocardium than in normal myocardium, whereas there was no significantly statistical difference in intravascular agent-enhanced T-1 signal intensity between scarred and normal myocardium. Conclusion: After administration of extracellular agents, wash-out T-2(*) first-pass and delayed enhanced T-1 MRI could identify scarred myocardium as a hyperenhanced region. Conversely, scarred myocardium was indistinguishable from normal myocardium during first-pass and the steady state of intravascular agents.

AB Explanations that account for complex causation, emergence, and social-ecological interdependence are necessary for building theories of social-ecological phenomena. Social-ecological systems (SES) research has accumulated rich empirical understanding of SES; however, integration of this knowledge toward contextualized generalizations, or middle-range theories, remains challenging. We discuss the potential of an iterative and collaborative process that combines generalizing from case studies with agent-based modelling as an abductive methodology to successively build and test explanations rooted in complexity thinking. Collaboration between empirical researchers, theoreticians, practitioners, and modellers is imperative to accommodate this process, which can be seen as a first step toward building middle-range theories.

AB The scope of the Technical Forum Group (TFG) on Agents in Bioinformatics (BIOAGENTS) was to inspire collaboration between the agent and bioinformatics communities with the aim of creating an opportunity to propose a different (agent-based) approach to the development of computational frameworks both for data analysis in bioinformatics and for system modelling in computational biology. During the day, the participants examined the future of research on agents in bioinformatics primarily through 12 invited talks selected to cover the most relevant topics. From the discussions, it became clear that there are many perspectives to the field, ranging from bio-conceptual languages for agent-based simulation, to the definition of bio-ontology-based declarative languages for use by information agents, and to the use of Grid agents, each of which requires further exploration. The interactions between participants encouraged the development of applications that describe a way of creating agent-based simulation models of biological systems, starting from an hypothesis and inferring new knowledge (or relations) by mining and analysing the huge amount of public biological data. In this report we summarize and reflect on the presentations and discussions.

AB This paper deals with the problem of signal source localization using a group of autonomous robots by designing and analyzing a decision-control approach with an event-triggered communication scheme. The proposed decision-control approach includes two levels: a decision level and a control level. In the decision level, a particle filter is used to estimate the possible positions of the signal source. The estimated position of the signal source gradually approaches the real position of signal source with the movement of robots. In the control level, a consensus controller is proposed to control multiple robots to seek a signal source based on the estimated signal source position. At the same time, an event-triggered communication scheme is designed such that the burden of communication can be lightened. Finally, simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed decision-control approach with the event-triggered communication scheme for the problem of signal source localization.

ID ARTIFICIAL ADAPTIVE AGENTS; MARKET ENTRY GAMES; COORDINATION; EXCHANGE;

AB In recent years there has been some interest in applying Artificial Adaptive Agents (AAA) to the study of complex adaptive systems, especially economic systems. Neural networks are frequently employed as AAA. Artificial neural nets mimic certain aspects of the physical structure and information processing of the human brain and their most attractive characteristic is their ability to learn a pattern from a given set of examples. In this study, we investigated the ability of neural nets to model human behavior in a group decision process. The context was a market entry game with a linear payoff function and binary decisions. The players had to decide, for each trial, whether or not to enter a market whose capacity is public knowledge. Human behavior in this situation has been modeled and empirically validated by the Nash equilibrium for noncooperative n-person games. A simulation of the game was performed with neural nets instead of human subjects. The nets were trained using the results of the games in which they participated. The simulation with groups of neural nets exhibits phenomena very similar to those observed in groups of human players.

AB Aim: In the current study we evaluated adverse effects of monosodium glutamate (MSG) on memory formation and its retrieval as well as the role of ascorbic acid (Vitamin-C) in prevention of MSG-induced alteration of neurobehavioral performance in periadolescent rats.
   Materials and methods: Healthy male albino Wistar rats (4-6 weeks old), were randomly allotted in four groups. Group I: normal control, who remained in their homecage throughout the experimental period. Group II: vehicle control, who were orally administered with normal saline for three weeks. Group III: MSG, who were orally administered with aqueous solution of MSG (2 mg/g b.w/day), for three weeks. Group IV: MSG+AA, who were administered with aqueous solution of MSG, and subsequently by ascorbic acid (100 mg/kg b.w/day) orally for three weeks. After the experimental period, all animals from all groups were first tested for anxiety followed by passive avoidance behavior.
   Results: MSG significantly altered the neurobehavioral performance in rats. The alteration manifested as less time spent on the open arm during the EPM test and shorter entrance latency to the dark compartment during the passive avoidance task. All behavioral changes were significantly prevented by simultaneous administration of ascorbic acid with MSG.
   Conclusion: The present data point to the neuroprotective role of ascorbic acid. The ascorbic acid can be used as a therapeutic agent in various cognitive deficits (Fig. 5, Ref. 25). Full Text (Free, PDF) www.bmj.sk.

The fundamental robustness problem in practical application involving initial state shifts, disturbances, noises, and communication time-delays are considered. The distributed algorithm is proposed for each robot in directed network, which is based on the iterative learning rule with both predictive and current learning terms. It is shown that the convergence of formation tracking objective can be guaranteed under a matrix norm condition by using the two-dimensional analysis approach. Numerical simulation and experiment are both given to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

TI Model and reconstruction of a K-edge contrast agent distribution with an
   X-ray photon-counting detector
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
LA English
DT Article
ID CT; SIMULATION
AB Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) helps enhance the visibility for tumor imaging. When a high-Z contrast agent interacts with X-rays across its K-edge, X-ray photoelectric absorption would experience a sudden increment, resulting in a significant difference of the X-ray transmission intensity between the left and right energy windows of the K-edge. Using photon-counting detectors, the X-ray intensity data in the left and right windows of the K-edge can be measured simultaneously. The differential information of the two kinds of intensity data reflects the contrast-agent concentration distribution. K-edge differences between various matters allow opportunities for the identification of contrast agents in biomedical applications. In this paper, a general radon transform is established to link the contrast-agent concentration to X-ray intensity measurement data. An iterative algorithm is proposed to reconstruct a contrast-agent distribution and tissue attenuation background simultaneously. Comprehensive numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the merits of the proposed method over the existing K-edge imaging methods. Our results show that the proposed method accurately quantifies a distribution of a contrast agent, optimizing the contrast-to-noise ratio at a high dose efficiency.

AB In case of a failure in the cooling or the electric supply and thus a stirrer break down, exothermic reactions can be self-accelerated caused by the heating-up of the reactor content, so that the danger of an unallowed rise in temperature and pressure occurs. In certain chemical processes (e. g. radical polymerization) a reaction-runaway can be stopped by the addition of inhibiting agents. With rapid and homogeneous distribution of the inhibiting agent by means of a fluid stored under pressure the endangered reactor can be controlled. In order to obtain design criteria for this safety device, the influence of relevant system parameters in the reaction and mixing behaviour has to be examined. Therefore experimental investigations and numerical simulations were made.

AB The aim of the work was to assess the influence of some non-enzymatic antioxidants (uric acid, blood urea, bilirubin) on the antioxidant status of rat's organism during the experimental acute haemorrhagic necrotising pancreatitis. The experiment was carried out on male Wistar rats, body weight 280-320 g, which were divided randomly into control and experimental groups. The control group (n=8) underwent laparotomy. The experimental group (n=24) was injected into pancreatic duct with natrium taurocholate to induce acute pancreatitis - according to the Heinkel and Aho method. Total antioxidation status in plasma was assessed according to the Benzie method (FRAP); total bilirubin, urea, and uric acid in plasma were assessed as described elsewhere. These parameters were examined in each group 3 h, 24 h, and 48 h after the experiment started. Simultaneously a-amylase activity (indicator of pancreatitis severity) was assessed in plasma. The obtained results were analysed statistically. Pancreatitis achieved its maximum severity 24 h after the beginning of the experiment and then decreased. After 48 h alpha-amylase activity was only 2 times higher than that in the control group. FRAP maximum was noticed just after 3 h, then became lower and 48 It after the experiment onset its minimal value was 2 times lower than that of the control. Uric acid and bilirubin plasma concentration grew up 24 h after experiment beginning and next decreased. Only plasma urea concentration increased stably to the maximum value which was observed 24 h after the operation and after 48 h only slight decrease in its concentration was noticed. This phenomenon may be the result of parenchymatous organs damage occurring in acute haemorrhagic necrotising pancreatitis. It leads to interlobular and periadenous tissue necrosis as a consequence of lipid peroxidation. The obtained results showed the booster effect of non-enzymatic antioxidant agents on total antioxidant status during experimental pancreatitis. This effect correlated with pancreatitis severity which was evidenced by an increased alpha-amylase activity in plasma.

Using consensus protocol and sliding mode algorithm, a distributed finite-time fault-tolerant formation control scheme is developed. The whole closed-loop system is composed by position loop, attitude loop, and propeller speed loop. A propeller speed fault-tolerant controller is developed to deal with the unexpected faults of quadrotors. The finite-time stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed through Lyapunov analysis. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed algorithm is illustrated by some numerical simulations.

ID CONTACT HYPOTHESIS
AB Community psychologists are interested in creating contexts that promote both respect for diversity and sense of community. However, recent theoretical and empirical work has uncovered a community-diversity dialectic wherein the contextual conditions that foster respect for diversity often run in opposition to those that foster sense of community. More specifically, within neighborhoods, residential integration provides opportunities for intergroup contact that are necessary to promote respect for diversity but may prevent the formation of dense interpersonal networks that are necessary to promote sense of community. Using agent-based modeling to simulate neighborhoods and neighborhood social network formation, we explore whether the community-diversity dialectic emerges from two principles of relationship formation: homophily and proximity. The model suggests that when people form relationships with similar and nearby others, the contexts that offer opportunities to develop a respect for diversity are different from the contexts that foster a sense of community. Based on these results, we conclude with a discussion of whether it is possible to create neighborhoods that simultaneously foster respect for diversity and sense of community.

AB Sufficient and appropriate documentation of a simulation model forms an essential prerequisite for quality assessment as well as for activities of maintenance, reuse, or reproduction of the model and its results. This is true for every simulation paradigm. However, in particular for agent-based simulations with their high degree of freedom in design, their usually complex behavior and interactions, their high level of detail and heterogeneity, etc., documentation becomes indispensable, and also problematic. This article contributes to general advancement of the methodological basis of agent-based simulations by presenting a structured way of documenting agent-based simulation models. We propose a documentation framework that consists of six different categories of model information: metadata, informal model characterization, model contents, expected simulation behavior, experimental frame, and passed tests.

AB There has been extensive empirical research in recent years pointing to a weak correlation between economic growth and subjective well-being (happiness), at least for developed economies (i.e. the so-called 'Easterlin paradox'). Recent findings from the behavioural sciences and happiness literature link this paradoxical relationship to negative externalities on utility imposed by social comparison (i.e. relative income with respect to others) and adaptation (habituation to own income in the past). We believe that the type of economic growth (pro-poor, pro-middle, pro-rich, neutral), in combination with sensitivity to social comparison and past income, is a key determinant of happiness trajectories and future utility levels. With the use of agent-based simulations we examine the long-term dynamics of subjective-well-being by focusing attention on the type of growth process rather than the mere size of income growth. We generally find that pro-middle (and balanced) growth corresponds to much higher levels of long-term happiness in comparison to pro-rich growth.

AB This paper proposes a universal control strategy and novel haptic interface for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) welding/machining robot. The developed method implements a reliable position control and sense between the human and the robot as well as between the robot and the task environment in which provides highly accurate position control based on joystick inputs with real-time haptic capabilities. The proposed control structure has the characteristics of a universal technique independent of the actual control algorithm and it can be applied with other suitable control methods as a real-time control strategy. One of the contributions of this paper is that the proposed control method combines a directed random search method and real-time simulation to develop an intelligent controller in which each generation of parameters is tested on-line by the real-time simulator before being applied to the real process. The controller was evaluated on a hydraulic position servo system where the simulator of the hydraulic system was built based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. A Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm combined with the foraging behavior of E. coli bacteria was utilized as the directed random search engine. PSO is influenced by the simulation of social behavior in which each individual agent of the possible solution population, benefits from its history and its interactions with other agents within the population. This sharing of knowledge helps facilitate faster convergence to an optimal solution. From the other side, the effect of Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) of E. coli is that the agent is making a decision to which position to move. The agent does this with attention to the previous data stored in the memory as the best past position. These selection behaviors of particles help to avoid poor foraging and improve foraging strategies. In conclusion, the proposed control and haptic strategy allows the operator to be kinetically plugged into the work environment and simultaneously provides force feedback sense with high controllability without neglecting the system dynamics.

The photomineralization of nitrogen and carbon atoms in the substrates into N-2 gas, NH4+ (and/or NO3-) ions, and CO2 gas was determined by HPLC and GC analysis. The formation of carboxylic acid intermediates also occurred in the photooxidation process. The photocatalytic mechanism is discussed on the basis of the experimental results, and with molecular orbital (MO) simulation of frontier electron density and point charge. Substrate carbonyl groups readily adsorb on the TiO2 surface, and the bonds between carbonyl group carbon atoms and adjacent hydrate group nitrogen atoms are cleaved predominantly in the initial photooxidation process. The hydrate groups were photoconverted mainly into N-2 gas (in mineralization yields above 70%) and partially to NH4+ ions (below 10%). The formation of NO3- ions was scarcely recognized.

ID STOCK-MARKET; MODEL; PRICE; FLUCTUATIONS; BEHAVIOR
AB This paper introduces an agent-based artificial financial market in which heterogeneous agents trade one single asset through a realistic trading mechanism for price formation. Agents are initially endowed with a finite amount of cash and a given finite portfolio of assets. There is no money-creation process; the total available cash is conserved in time. In each period, agents make random buy and sell decisions that are constrained by available resources, subject to clustering, and dependent on the volatility of previous periods. The model proposed herein is able to reproduce the leptokurtic shape of the probability density of log price returns and the clustering of volatility. Implemented using extreme programming and object-oriented technology, the simulator is a flexible computational experimental facility that can find applications in both academic and industrial research projects.

ID TIME-DELAY; AGENTS; NETWORKS
AB This work deals with the analysis of the consensus problem for networks of agents constituted by single and double integrator systems. It is assumed that the communication among agents is affected by a constant time-delay. Previous and numerous analysis of the problem shows that the maximum communication time-delay that can be introduced to the network without affecting the consensus of the group of the agents depends on the considered topology. In this work, a control scheme that is based on the estimation of future states of the agents and that allows increasing the magnitude of a possible time-delay affecting the communication channels is proposed. How the proposed delay compensation strategy is independent of the network topology in the sense that the maximum allowable time-delay that could be supported by the network depends on a design parameter and not on the maximum eigenvalue of the corresponding Laplacian matrix is shown. It is formally proven that, under the proposed prediction scheme, the consensus of the group can be achieved by improving the maximum time-delay bounds previously reported in the literature. Numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed solution.

AB We have developed a Soccer simulator in Java, which allows us to evaluate agent behavioral strategies for effectively collaborating with other team members while countering threats posed by the opposing team. Whereas action selection mechanisms to decide when to shoot, pass, dribble, guard opponent, tackle, etc. are important from a player's viewpoint, learning the capabilities of individual opponents from repeated encounters can provide critical information for the success of a team. Each agent is described by a set of skill levels for different soccer skills. A soccer agent uses its incomplete perceptions, model of the changing environment, knowledge of the skill levels of its own team players, and estimated skill levels of the opponent team players to select the most prudent action. In this paper, we identify learning opportunities for soccer agents, and investigate some of these possibilities in detail. Initial experimental results demonstrate the advantage of learning agents.

AB Creating agents that realistically simulate and interact with people is an important problem. In this paper we present strong empirical evidence that such agents should be based on bounded rationality, and specifically on key elements from Aspiration Adaptation Theory (AAT). First, we analyzed the strategies people described they would use to solve two relatively basic optimization problems involving one and two parameters. Second, we studied the agents a different group of people wrote to solve these same problems. We then studied two realistic negotiation problems involving five and six parameters. Again, first we studied the negotiation strategies people used when interacting with other people. Then we studied two state of the art automated negotiation agents and negotiation sessions between these agents and people. We found that in both the optimizing and negotiation problems the overwhelming majority of automated agents and people used key elements from AAT, even when optimal solutions, machine learning techniques for solving multiple parameters, or bounded techniques other than AAT could have been implemented. We discuss the implications of our findings including suggestions for designing more effective agents for game and simulation environments.

AB To improve problem-solving performance, individuals can rely on social learning. This approach is constrained by an individual's social network, which influences the efficiency of the problem-solving process. To date, research disagrees on what kind of network structure is preferable, providing support for efficient network structures, as well as for inefficient networks. However, studies implicitly assume that solvers always imitate superior solutions, an assumption that lacks empirical grounding. We propose a simple derivation of an existing simulation framework by incorporating a known cognitive bias ('IKEA effect'), whereby individuals are assumed to prioritize individual information. This effect allows inefficiencies to be embodied at the individual microlevel, reducing the need for inefficiencies at the structural macrolevel. Simulation results explain discrepancies in previous results, illustrating how more realistic microlevel assumptions substantially impact macrolevel outcomes.

AB Agent-based models informed by empirical data are growing in popularity. Many models make extensive use of collected data for the development, initialisation or validation. In parallel, models are growing in size and complexity, generating large amounts of output data. On the other hand, Data Mining is used to extract hidden patterns from large collections of data using different techniques. This work proposes the intense use of Data Mining techniques for the improvement and development of agent-based models. It presents a methodological approach explaining why and when to use Data Mining, with a formal description of each stage of the corresponding process. This is illustrated with a case study, showing the application of the proposed approach step by step.

AB Sustainable management of complex human-environment systems, and the essential services they provide, remains a major challenge, felt from local to global scales. These systems are typically highly dynamic and hard to predict, particularly in the context of rapid environmental change, where novel sets of conditions drive coupled socio-economic-environmental responses. Faced with these challenges, our tools for policy development, while informed by the past experience, must not be unduly constrained; they must allow equally for both the fine-tuning of successful existing approaches and the generation of novel ones in unbiased ways. We study ocean fisheries as an example class of complex human-environmental systems, and present a new model (POSEIDON) and computational approach to policy design. The model includes an adaptive agent-based representation of a fishing fleet, coupled to a simplified ocean ecology model. The agents (fishing boats) do not have programmed responses based on empirical data, but respond adaptively, as a group, to their environment (including policy constraints). This conceptual model captures qualitatively a wide range of empirically observed fleet behaviour, in response to a broad set of policies. Within this framework, we define policy objectives (of arbitrary complexity) and use Bayesian optimization over multiple model runs to find policy parameters that best meet the goals. The trade-offs inherent in this approach are explored explicitly. Taking this further, optimization is used to generate novel hybrid policies. We illustrate this approach using simulated examples, in which policy prescriptions generated by our computational methods are counterintuitive and thus unlikely to be identified by conventional frameworks.

AB The binding modes of many hERG ion channel blockers are well understood, but a notable exception is clofilium, a potent antiarrhythmic agent whose action relies on blocking the current mediated by hERG. From the previously hypothesized binding modes of clofilium to hERG, only two can explain most of the experimental results. In this study, computer simulations are performed in order to analyze the hypothesized binding modes and to identify the consensus one. This is accomplished by employing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and interaction energy calculations. The results show an unexpected binding mode, in which the quaternary nitrogen is placed in the upper part of the inner cavity, interacting strongly with Ser624, while the chlorophenyl group is located in the lower part, in better agreement with previous experimental results. This novel binding position also explains the higher affinity of clofilium for the related hEag1 channel and was correlated with the possibility that potent hERG blockers interact in specific ways with the residues near the intracellular activation gate, offering a new explanation that could help predict the potency of other hERG-blocking compounds.

AB Creep generally showed a great impact on the temperature stress of concrete structure. At present, little research has been done on the creep law of cemented sand and gravel (CSG), and the calculation of creep temperature stress mainly adopts a set of relevant parameters. In this context, experimental compressive creep tests were carried out on the specimens of large-sized cylinders with different cementing agent contents; the creep temperature stress of CSG was also calculated. The results showed that the creep of CSG increased with the increase of cementing agent content, but the specific creep was not obvious. In addition, the creep model of CSG with high accuracy was also obtained, which could provide a basis for the numerical simulation of CSG dam. Furthermore, the results of numerical simulation showed that creep has a great influence on the stress of CSG dam, and the thermal stress energy was less than 37%. At the same time, it was necessary to determine whether temperature control should be considered according to different cementing agent content and external climate conditions, which cannot be generalized.

AB Many collaborative multi-robot application domains have limited areas of operation that cause spatial conflicts between robotic teammates. These spatial conflicts can cause the team's productivity to drop with the addition of robots. This phenomenon is impacted by the coordination methods used by the team-members, as different coordination methods yield radically different productivity results. However, selecting the best coordination method to be used by teammates is a formidable task. This paper presents techniques for creating adaptive coordination methods to address this challenge. We first present a combined coordination cost measure, CCC, to quantify the cost of group interactions. Our measure is useful for facilitating comparison between coordination methods, even when multiple cost factors are considered. We consistently find that as CCC values grow, group productivity falls. Using the CCC, we create adaptive coordination techniques that are able to dynamically adjust the efforts spent on coordination to match the number of perceived coordination conflicts in a group. We present two adaptation heuristics that are completely distributed and require no communication between robots. Using these heuristics, robots independently estimate their combined coordination cost (CCC), adjust their coordination methods to minimize it, and increase group productivity. We use simulated robots to perform thousands of experiment trials to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. We show that using adaptive coordination methods create a statistically significant improvement in productivity over static methods, regardless of the group size. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to formulate experimental dental adhesives with wollastonite and evaluate the physical, chemical, and bioactivity properties of the resins.
   Methods: Wollastonite was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray and laser diffraction analyses, and scanning electronic microscopy. An experimental adhesive resin was formulated, and wollastonite was used as filler at 0 (control group), 0.5, 1, or 2 wt.%. Radiopacity, degree of conversion (DC%), micro-hardness, softening in solvent, ultimate tensile strength (UTS), 24 h- and 1 year-microtensile bond strength (mu TBS), mineral deposition, and color of the adhesives were evaluated.
   Results: Wollastonite particles showed a needle-like shape, a mean diameter of 70 (+/- 30) mu m, characteristic chemical peaks, and pure crystalline beta-CaSiO3 phase. There were no significant differences (p > 0.05) for radiopacity, softening in solvent, and color change. The group with 2 wt.% of wollastonite showed higher microhardness and UTS in comparison to the control group (p < 0.05). After one year, the control group showed reduced mu TBS compared to the immediate value (p < 0.05). The groups with wollastonite presented stable mu TBS after one year in comparison to the immediate mu TBS (p > 0.05). Wollastonite induced mineral deposition on the adhesive surface over the time of storage in simulated body fluid.
   Conclusion: The addition of wollastonite improved the mechanical behavior of the adhesive without changing the analyzed chemical properties. The adhesives with this filler presented mineral deposition and acceptable clinical color. Moreover, dentin treated with wollastonite-doped adhesives showed higher bonding stability after one year of aging.
   Clinical significance: : Wollastonite, a silicate-based material, provided bioactivity for the adhesives, which assists in producing therapeutic tooth-restoration interfaces. Moreover, the incorporation of this mineral improOfiller to improve the biological properties of adhesives and assist in dentin-restoration stability.

AB Agent-based modeling is an effective way of understanding and analyzing complex adaptive phenomena. In this respect, discovering the relationship between inputs and outputs of agent-based models is the ultimate way of providing insights into understanding the dynamics of the system being modeled. Therefore, there are many approaches in the literature to clarify these relationships including sampling and metamodeling. Emphasizing the weaknesses and disadvantages of current methods, we present a metamodel-guided sequential sampling technique which combines random forests and uncertainty sampling. Experimental results on two wellknown agent-based models show that the presented technique yields metamodels of higher accuracy compared to metamodels trained with randomly selected input-output data. Contrary to the previous studies emphasizing only the improvement in the metamodel accuracy, we also focus on input parameter combinations selected by the sequential sampling technique, and we observe that sequential sampling is able to capture the boundaries of tipping point behaviors as well as the points exhibiting counter-intuitive behavior, thus, potentially aiding verification, validation, and understanding of agent-based models. Additionally, we propose a novel two-step method for the categorization of the agent-based model outputs prior to metamodel training, which helps the analyst to decide on whether preserving numerical model outputs or continuing the metamodel training procedure with qualitative categorical agent-based model outputs.

AB Mobile agent is a kind of program which can transfer via asynchronous mode independently in the sensor network with outstanding prospects in application. However, due to the openness of the sensor network, mobile agents are facing the threat of security, such as being stolen and modified. How to protect sensors from attacks of malicious mobile agents becomes an important issue in the field. Traditional access control strategies such as hybrid encryption mechanism, partial results of the package, and other methods have some defects in the application. We design a multisensor interaction trust model with complete distribution and introduce incomplete distribution to optimize the trust model according to the actual situation of detection data loss for mobile agent system in the wireless sensor networks. In addition, the introduction of the malicious behavior feedback mechanism ensures the security of sensors in the mobile agent system. The experimental results show that the reputation model of incomplete distribution can simulate the actual situation well, resist the attacks of malicious agents, and ensure the security of sensors in the system.

AB Because costly punishment is not credible, subgame perfection suggests that punishment will not deter free riding, regardless of the size or structure of groups. However, experiments show that people will punish free riders. even at considerable cost. To examine the implications of agents who punish, we simulate an environment populated with behavioral strategies seen in the lab and use the simulation to develop hypotheses about why group size should matter when punishment is allowed. We test these hypotheses experimentally and examine whether the effect of group size is purely due to the number of group members or if information about other group members is what is important. We find that large groups contribute at rates no lower than small groups because punishment does not fall appreciably in large groups. However, hindrances to monitoring do reduce the provision of the public good. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper extends Selten et al.'s (Games Econ Behav 58: 394-406, 2007) laboratory experiment of an agent's choice behavior by offering eight subjects a choice between one of two facilities that provide an identical service. We assume that the cost of using these facilities depends on their congestion level and that there are two types of agents with different congestion costs: high-and low-cost agents. High-cost agents are affected by congestion more severely than low-cost agents. The theory of congestion games predicts that cost heterogeneity will not affect the facility choices of agents. We obtain experimental results that support this theoretical prediction, namely that cost heterogeneity influences neither the facility choices of agents nor the congestion levels of facilities. By using data derived from the laboratory experiment, we then develop state-action tables and computationally simulate the facility choices of subjects. We find that a subject decides whether he or she remains in the same facility or moves to the other facility in the next period according to the current congestion level.

AB One of the most promising fields for ambient intelligence is the implementation of intelligent emergency plans. Because the use of drills and living labs cannot reproduce social behaviors, such as panic attacks, that strongly affect these plans, the use of agent-based social simulation provides an approach to evaluate these plans more thoroughly. (1) The hypothesis presented in this paper is that there has been little interest in describing the key modules that these simulators must include, such as formally represented knowledge and a realistic simulated sensor model, and especially in providing researchers with tools to reuse, extend and interconnect modules from different works. This lack of interest hinders researchers from achieving a holistic framework for evaluating emergency plans and forces them to reconsider and to implement the same components from scratch over and over. In addition to supporting this hypothesis by considering over 150 simulators, this paper: (2) defines the main modules identified and proposes the use of semantic web technologies as a cornerstone for the aforementioned holistic framework; (3) provides a basic methodology to achieve the framework; (4) identifies the main challenges; and (5) presents an open and free software tool to hint at the potential of such a holistic view of emergency plan evaluation in indoor environments.

TI Dynamics of three-agent games
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL

ID MODEL
AB We study the dynamics and resulting score distribution of three-agent games where after each competition a single agent wins and scores a point. A single competition is described by a triplet of numbers p, t and q denoting the probabilities that the team with the highest, middle or lowest accumulated score wins. The three-agent game can be regarded as a social model where a player can be favored or disfavored for advancement, based on his/her accumulated score. We study the full family of solutions in the regime, where the number of agents and competitions is large, which can be regarded as a hydrodynamic limit. Depending on the parameter values (p, q, t), we find six qualitatively different asymptotic score distributions and we provide a qualitative explanation of these results. We also compare our analytical results against numerical simulations of the microscopic model and find these to be in excellent agreement. It is possible to decide the outcome of a three-agent game through a mini-tournament of two-agent competitions among the participating players and it turns out that the resulting possible score distributions are a subset of those obtained for the general three-agent games. We discuss how one can add a steady and democratic decline rate to the model and present a simple geometric construction that allows one to obtain the score evolution equations for n-agent games.

AB The paper proposes an attitude synchronization algorithm of rigid bodies on Special Orthogonal Group SO(3), with parameter uncertainties, external disturbances, gyro biases and communication delays. A set of two-order linear filters are introduced to cope with discontinuous communication delays, and only attitude information is required to be exchanged between rigid bodies. Then a set of gyro bias estimators are constructed with exponential convergence rates in the constant bias case and can also deal with time-varying gyro biases. Besides, a novel attractive manifold control method is also proposed so that the parameter estimation error terms can converge to zeros independent of persistent excitation condition. The proposed attractive manifold control method can be also robust toward external disturbances. The obtained control inputs are continuous and ensure the control performance of the closed-loop system, in the presence of discontinuous communication delays, external disturbances, parameter uncertainties and gyro biases. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified in the numerical simulations.

   MODEL
AB By means of extensive computer simulations, the authors consider the entangled coevolution of actions and social structure in a new version of a spatial Prisoner's Dilemma model that naturally gives way to a process of social differentiation. Diverse social roles emerge from the dynamics of the system: leaders are individuals getting a large payoff who are imitated by a considerable fraction of the population, conformists are unsatisfied cooperative agents that keep cooperating, and exploiters are defectors with a payoff larger than the average one obtained by cooperators. The dynamics generate a social network that can have the topology of a small world network. The network has a strong hierarchical structure in which the leaders play an essential role in sustaining a highly cooperative stable regime. But disruptions affecting leaders produce social crises described as dynamical cascades that propagate through the network.

ID STRUCTURAL BALANCE
AB There is a longstanding belief that in social networks with simultaneous friendly and hostile interactions (signed networks) there is a general tendency to a global balance. Balance represents a state of the network with a lack of contentious situations. Here we introduce a method to quantify the degree of balance of any signed (social) network. It accounts for the contribution of all signed cycles in the network and gives, in agreement with empirical evidence, more weight to the shorter cycles than to the longer ones. We found that, contrary to what is generally believed, many signed social networks, in particular very large directed online social networks, are in general very poorly balanced. We also show that unbalanced states can be changed by tuning the weights of the social interactions among the agents in the network.

AB In the last few years, all countries worldwide have fought the spread of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) by exploiting Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to perform contact tracing. In parallel, the pandemic has highlighted the relevance of mobility and social distancing among citizens. The monitoring of such aspects appeared prominent for reactive decision-making and the effective tracking of the infection chain. In parallel to the proximity sensing among people, indeed, the concept of social distancing has captured the attention to signal processing algorithms enabling short-to-medium range distance estimation to provide behavioral models in the emergency. By exploiting the availability of smart devices, the synergy between mobile network connectivity and Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), cooperative ranging approaches allow computing inter-personal distance measurements in outdoor environments through the exchange of light-weight navigation data among interconnected users. In this paper, a model for Inter-Agent Ranging (IAR) is provided and experimentally assessed to offer a naive collaborative distancing technique that leverages these features. Although the technique provides distance information, it does not imply the disclosure of the user's locations being intrinsically prone to protect sensitive user data. A statistical error model is presented and validated through synthetic simulations and real, on-field experiments to support implementation in GNSS-equipped mobile devices. Accuracy and precision of IAR measurements are compared to other consolidated GNSS-based techniques showing comparable performance at lower complexity and computational effort.

AB Afacile and rapid microwave-assisted green route has been used for the formation of Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) and the reduction of graphene oxide (GO) simultaneously with five different reducing agents, sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), sodium citrate, urea and ascorbic acid. The experimental results show that the structural properties and phase of Ag/reduced graphene oxide (Ag/rGO) nanocomposites are connected with reducing agent. AgNPs can be uniformly and compactly anchored on reducedGO(rGO) surface in the microwave field for 2 min by the assist of NaOH or KOH as reducing agent. The OH- can not only accelerate the ionization of acidic functional groups but also act as the nucleophile for Ag+. By addition of sodium citrate and urea, theGOsample remains its original structure, and Ag+ tends to form Ag2CO3, which then decomposes into Ag2O. While in the urea solution, Ag(2)Oturns into [ Ag(NH3) (2)](+) ions with abundant urea, then [ Ag(NH3) (2)](+) ions are reduced to Ag-0 by electrons, which leads to both Ag and Ag2O phase coexisting in the urea treated samples. In addition, it can be found that NaOHshows the best results in terms of the crystallinity and purity of Ag grains anchored on rGO surface.

AB We propose to extend demographic multistate models by adding a behavioural element: behavioural rules explain intentions and thus transitions. Our framework is inspired by the Theory of Planned Behaviour. We exemplify our approach with a model of migration from Senegal to France. Model parameters are determined using empirical data where available. Parameters for which no empirical correspondence exists are determined by calibration. Age- and period-specific migration rates are used for model validation. Our approach adds to the toolkit of demographic projection by allowing for shocks and social influence, which alter behaviour in non-linear ways, while sticking to the general framework of multistate modelling. Our simulations yield that higher income growth in Senegal leads to higher emigration rates in the medium term, while a decrease in fertility yields lower emigration rates.

AB In the present study, closed-cell aluminum foams of varying porosities (65-75%) were produced through the stir casting technique using TiH2(1 wt.%) as a foaming agent. Under the uniaxial compressive loading, the compressive stress-strain responses of these foams were examined. The finite element (FE) models of the foam were elaborated using the ABAQUS FE simulation software and realized via the ABAQUS Explicit solver. Within the test domain, the experimental results were compared with the FE-predicted ones for the same porosities and both yielded similar stress-strain responses. The energy absorption capacity, yield stress, and densification strain values of AFs obtained through FE simulation were in good agreement with the experimental results, while the predicted plateau stress values differed from the latter by no more than 4-5%.

AB This article constructs a foundation for warfare at the individual level, where agents in two groups fire and absorb shots according to a non-stationary Poisson process. We determine for generalized forms of warfare the conditional and unconditional point probabilities of a certain number of agents in each group through time, and the conditional and unconditional expected sizes and variances. Conditional variables are especially useful in modern warfare since these allow for updated intelligence. We determine the conditions for discrepancies between the stochastic version and the associated Lanchester model. Correspondence is demonstrated for square warfare for large groups where the probability that a group goes extinct is negligible. For linear warfare equivalence occurs for the conditional case, whereas for the unconditional case correspondence arises at the limit where the covariance of the group sizes approaches zero. Finally the stochastic model is tested against newly released empirics for the Ardennes Campaign during World War II. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A Monte Carlo algorithm has been developed to investigate the effects of multiple scattering on the volume scattering function measured by the LISST-VSF instrument. The developed algorithm is compared to experimental results obtained from bench-top measurements using 508 nm spherical polystyrene beads and Arizona test dust as scattering agents. The Monte Carlo simulation predicts measured volume scattering functions at all concentrations. We demonstrate that multiple scattered light can be a major contributor to the detected signal, resulting in errors in the measured volume scattering function and its derived inherent optical properties. We find a relative error of 10% in the scattering coefficient for optical depths similar to 0.4, and it can reach 100% at optical depths similar to 2.

AB Urban growth models are useful tools to understand the patterns and processes of urbanization. In recent years, the bottom-up approach of geo-computation, such as cellular automata and agent-based modeling, is commonly used to simulate urban land-use dynamics. This study has developed an integrated model of urban growth called agent-integrated irregular automata (AIIA) by using vector geographic information system environment (i.e. both the data model and operations). The model was tested for the city of San Marcos, Texas to simulate two scenarios of urban growth. Specifically, the study aimed to answer whether incorporating commercial, industrial and institutional agents in the model and using social theories (e.g. utility functions) improves the conventional urban growth modeling. By validating against empirical land-use data, the results suggest that a holistic framework such as AIIA performs better than the existing irregular-automata-based urban growth modeling.

AB This article presents an agent-based model of a health-related Internet forum. If recent literature demonstrates the relevance of network approaches to gain insight into consensus-building within online groups of peers, the dynamic process of mutual adjustment of participants' health orientations has been seldom explored. Our model is informed by qualitative data collected via semi-structured interviews with Internet users living with eating disorders often stigmatized due to the controversies surrounding "pro-ana" (anorexia) websites. The discussion threads that unfold in the forum, expressing a range of health orientations from extreme "pro-pathology" to "pro-recovery" ones, initiate a mix of conflicting and supportive reactions that can trigger change in members' orientations over time. We develop a computer simulation of message exchanges in a forum, describing micro-behaviors through a simple mechanism of influence. We then complexify the macro-setting, considering the effects of turnover (the possibility of exiting and/or entering the forum), and different rates of active participation of members to discussions. Our model shows that under empirically plausible conditions, moderate pro-recovery orientations are more likely to emerge than radical ones refusing medical mediation. These results lead to policy recommendations to design successful health information campaigns, and advocate against access restrictions or filtering of these online communities.

TI Impact of tumor-parenchyma biomechanics on liver metastatic progression:
   a multi-model approach
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB Colorectal cancer and other cancers often metastasize to the liver in later stages of the disease, contributing significantly to patient death. While the biomechanical properties of the liver parenchyma (normal liver tissue) are known to affect tumor cell behavior in primary and metastatic tumors, the role of these properties in driving or inhibiting metastatic inception remains poorly understood, as are the longer-term multicellular dynamics. This study adopts a multi-model approach to study the dynamics of tumor-parenchyma biomechanical interactions during metastatic seeding and growth. We employ a detailed poroviscoelastic model of a liver lobule to study how micrometastases disrupt flow and pressure on short time scales. Results from short-time simulations in detailed single hepatic lobules motivate constitutive relations and biological hypotheses for a minimal agent-based model of metastatic growth in centimeter-scale tissue over months-long time scales. After a parameter space investigation, we find that the balance of basic tumor-parenchyma biomechanical interactions on shorter time scales (adhesion, repulsion, and elastic tissue deformation over minutes) and longer time scales (plastic tissue relaxation over hours) can explain a broad range of behaviors of micrometastases, without the need for complex molecular-scale signaling. These interactions may arrest the growth of micrometastases in a dormant state and prevent newly arriving cancer cells from establishing successful metastatic foci. Moreover, the simulations indicate ways in which dormant tumors could "reawaken" after changes in parenchymal tissue mechanical properties, as may arise during aging or following acute liver illness or injury. We conclude that the proposed modeling approach yields insight into the role of tumor-parenchyma biomechanics in promoting liver metastatic growth, and advances the longer term goal of identifying conditions to clinically arrest and reverse the course of late-stage cancer.

AB The paper presents a distributed cooperative control law for autonomous deployment of a team of heterogeneous agents. Deployment problems deal with the coordination of groups of agents in order to cover one or more assigned areas of the operational space. In particular, we consider a team composed by agents with different dynamics, sensing capabilities, and resources available for the deployment. Sensing heterogeneity is addressed by means of the descriptor function framework, an abstraction that provides a set of mathematical tools for describing both agent sensing capabilities and the desired deployment. A distributed cooperative control law is then formally derived finding a suboptimal solution of a cooperative differential game, where the agents are interested in achieving the requested deployment, while optimizing the resources usage according to their dynamics. The control law effectiveness is proven by theoretical arguments, and supported by numerical simulations.

ID PROTOCOL; POLICIES
AB Trying to find a parking space in a parking lot is a routine activity for most people in our society. However, in managing the sustained growth rate in the number of vehicle users, the demand on such parking facilities is likely to remain under constant pressure. Both the users and the management of parking lots use various strategies in dealing with the requirement for suitable parking facilities. This paper presents a computational model using an agent-based modelling technique to simulate two commonly used strategies applied to choosing a parking spot under various demand and supply conditions. The model is unique in the current literature, as it is specifically designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the strategies. The analysis of the experimental results shows that, in most conditions, accepting the first available parking spot and then walking to the destination performed better than driving as close as possible to the destination and then searching for an available parking spot.

AB A new selection method is developed for group contribution combined with molecular design for an extractant in liquid-liquid extraction. Based on the definition of extractant selectivity, the UNIversal Functional Activity Coefficient-group contribution method was first used for model building to preselect functional groups. Then, the molecular structures of extraction solvents were designed and determined according to the basic principle of group combination. Finally, the selectivity and distribution coefficients of candidate designed molecules were calculated to screen out the ideal extractant. For verification, it was applied to simulate potential extraction solvents for three typical biphasic systems and calculate related phase equilibrium data for all the components. Calculated results and experimental verification for the screened extraction agent proved that it was a good computational strategy for practical application in classical water-organic solvent equilibrium systems together with liquid-liquid separation compared with conventional ways.

ID NETWORK ANALYSIS; SCIENCE
AB Current analytical approaches in computational social science can be characterized by four dominant paradigms: text analysis (information extraction and classification), social network analysis (graph theory), social complexity analysis (complex systems science), and social simulations (cellular automata and agent-based modeling). However, when it comes to organizational and societal units of analysis, there exists no approach to conceptualize, model, analyze, explain, and predict social media interactions as individuals' associations with ideas, values, identities, and so on. To address this limitation, based on the sociology of associations and the mathematics of set theory, this paper presents a new approach to big data analytics called social set analysis. Social set analysis consists of a generative framework for the philosophies of computational social science, theory of social data, conceptual and formal models of social data, and an analytical framework for combining big social data sets with organizational and societal data sets. Three empirical studies of big social data are presented to illustrate and demonstrate social set analysis in terms of fuzzy set-theoretical sentiment analysis, crisp set-theoretical interaction analysis, and event studies-oriented set-theoretical visualizations. Implications for big data analytics, current limitations of the set-theoretical approach, and future directions are outlined.

ID MODELS
AB When introducing a new product into market, substantial amounts of resources are put at stake. Innovation managers therefore seek for reliable predictions of the respective innovation diffusion process. Making such predictions, however, is challenging, because the diffusion trajectory is affected by various factors such as the type of innovation, its perceived attributes, marketing activities and their impact, or consumers' individual communication and adoption behaviors. Modeling the diffusion of innovations accordingly is of interest for both practitioners and management scholars.
   An agent-based model can overcome many limitations of traditional approaches. It accounts for heterogeneity in consumer preferences as well as in the social structure of their interactions and allows for modeling consumers as boundedly rational agents who make decisions under uncertainty and are influenced by micro-level drivers of adoption. We introduce an agent-based model that deals with repeat purchase decisions, addresses the competitive diffusion of multiple products, and takes into consideration both the temporal and the spatial dimension of innovation diffusion. The corresponding simulation tool can support decision makers in analyzing the prospective diffusion of an innovation in scenarios that differ in pricing strategy, distribution strategy, and/or communication strategy. Its applicability is illustrated by means of an empirically grounded example for a second-generation biofuel. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   CHOICE
AB We explore the effects of social influence in a simple market model in which a large number of agents face a binary choice: to buy/not to buy a single unit of a product at a price posted by a single seller (monopoly market). We consider the case of positive externalities: an agent is more willing to buy if other agents make the same decision. We consider two special cases of heterogeneity in the individuals' decision rules, corresponding in the literature to the Random Utility Models of Thurstone, and of McFadden and Manski. In the first one the heterogeneity fluctuates with time, leading to a standard model in Physics: the Ising model at finite temperature (known as annealed disorder) in a uniform external field. In the second approach the heterogeneity among agents is fixed; in Physics this is a particular case of the quenched disorder model known as a random field Ising model, at zero temperature. We study analytically the equilibrium properties of the market in the limiting case where each agent is influenced by all the others (the mean field limit), and we illustrate some dynamic properties of these models making use of numerical simulations in an Agent based Computational Economics approach. Considering the optimization of the profit by the seller within the case of fixed heterogeneity with global externality, we exhibit a new regime where, if the mean willingness to pay increases and/or the production costs decrease, the seller's optimal strategy jumps from a solution with a high price and a small number of buyers, to another one with a low price and a large number of buyers. This regime, usually modelled with ad hoc bimodal distributions of the idiosyncratic heterogeneity, arises here for general monomodal distributions if the social influence is strong enough.

Simulated time series are compared with empirical data at different time scales (ticks, 1 s, 1 min, 5 min) in order to check the compliance of the model with some stylized facts. The modeled market structure is a dynamic multiplex with two layers: the first one is a star network, whose hub is the market maker (i.e., the owner of the venue holding the order book), where transactions are executed; the second one is designed according to different topologies, representing social interactions, where investors decide their behavior according to informative flows. The effect of imitation on market stability is discussed and some policy implications are provided.

TI Stability and robustness analysis of cooperation cycles driven by
   destructive agents in finite populations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
LA English
DT Article
ID EMERGENCE
AB The emergence and promotion of cooperation are two of the main issues in evolutionary game theory, as cooperation is amenable to exploitation by defectors, which take advantage of cooperative individuals at no cost, dooming them to extinction. It has been recently shown that the existence of purely destructive agents (termed jokers) acting on the common enterprises (public goods games) can induce stable limit cycles among cooperation, defection, and destruction when infinite populations are considered. These cycles allow for time lapses in which cooperators represent a relevant fraction of the population, providing a mechanism for the emergence of cooperative states in nature and human societies. Here we study analytically and through agent-based simulations the dynamics generated by jokers in finite populations for several selection rules. Cycles appear in all cases studied, thus showing that the joker dynamics generically yields a robust cyclic behavior not restricted to infinite populations. We also compute the average time in which the population consists mostly of just one strategy and compare the results with numerical simulations.

AB This paper explores the role social network capital might play in facilitating poor agents' escape from poverty traps. We model and simulate endogenous link formation among households heterogeneously endowed with both traditional and social network capital who make investment and technology choices over time in the absence of financial markets and faced with multiple production technologies featuring different fixed costs and returns. We show that social network capital can either complement or substitute for productive assets in facilitating some poor households' escape from poverty. However, the voluntary nature of costly link formation also creates exclusionary mechanisms that impede some poor households' use of social network capital. Through numerical simulation, we show that the ameliorative potential of social networks therefore depends fundamentally on the broader socio-economic wealth distribution in the economy, which determines the feasibility of social interactions and the net intertemporal benefits resulting from endogenous network formation. In some settings, targeted public transfers to the poor can crowd-in private resources by inducing new social links that the poor can exploit to escape from poverty.

   BIOLOGY; ALGORITHMS
AB Background: Probabilistic models have gained widespread acceptance in the systems biology community as a useful way to represent complex biological systems. Such models are developed using existing knowledge of the structure and dynamics of the system, experimental observations, and inferences drawn from statistical analysis of empirical data. A key bottleneck in building such models is that some system variables cannot be measured experimentally. These variables are incorporated into the model as numerical parameters. Determining values of these parameters that justify existing experiments and provide reliable predictions when model simulations are performed is a key research problem. Domain experts usually estimate the values of these parameters by fitting the model to experimental data. Model fitting is usually expressed as an optimization problem that requires minimizing a cost-function which measures some notion of distance between the model and the data. This optimization problem is often solved by combining local and global search methods that tend to perform well for the specific application domain. When some prior information about parameters is available, methods such as Bayesian inference are commonly used for parameter learning. Choosing the appropriate parameter search technique requires detailed domain knowledge and insight into the underlying system.
   Results: Using an agent-based model of the dynamics of acute inflammation, we demonstrate a novel parameter estimation algorithm by discovering the amount and schedule of doses of bacterial lipopolysaccharide that guarantee a set of observed clinical outcomes with high probability. We synthesized values of twenty-eight unknown parameters such that the parameterized model instantiated with these parameter values satisfies four specifications describing the dynamic behavior of the model.
   Conclusions: We have developed a new algorithmic technique for discovering parameters in complex stochastic models of biological systems given behavioral specifications written in a formal mathematical logic. Our algorithm uses Bayesian model checking, sequential hypothesis testing, and stochastic optimization to automatically synthesize parameters of probabilistic biological models.

AB Construction time optimization is affected greatly by the negotiation between owners and contractors, whose progress is dictated by their desire to maximize system revenues. This paper builds an agent-based model and designs an experimental scenario in which the contractor has competitive and social welfare preferences relevant to the Chinese context; we subdivide competitive preference into greed and jealousy components and subdivide social welfare preference into generosity and sympathy components. We analyze the impacts of these different contractor preferences on the revenue-sharing coefficient, negotiation success rate, and negotiation time when negotiation reaches agreement. The results show that the jealousy component of competitive preference has an important influence on improving the income of the subject, while the greed component does not significantly enhance the revenue-sharing coefficient. The sympathy component of social welfare preference does not have an influence on the revenue-sharing coefficient no matter the strength of the generosity component. Increasing the greed component of competitive preference will lead to the extension of negotiation time and, to a certain extent, to the reduction of the negotiation success rate; the sympathy component of social welfare preference does not have an influence on negotiation time no matter the strength of the generosity preference.

DE Bipartite networks; Online social dynamics; Agent-based modeling
AB We present an analysis of the empirical data and the agent-based modeling of the emotional behavior of users on the Web portals where the user interaction is mediated by posted comments, like Blogs and Diggs. We consider the dataset of discussion-driven popular Diggs, in which all comments are screened by machine-learning emotion detection in the text, to determine positive and negative valence (attractiveness and aversiveness) of each comment. By mapping the data onto a suitable bipartite network, we perform an analysis of the network topology and the related time-series of the emotional comments. The agent-based model is then introduced to simulate the dynamics and to capture the emergence of the emotional behaviors and communities. The agents are linked to posts on a bipartite network, whose structure evolves through their actions on the posts. The emotional states (arousal and valence) of each agent fluctuate in time, subject to the current contents of the posts to which the agent is exposed. By an agent's action on a post its current emotions are transferred to the post. The model rules and the key parameters are inferred from the considered empirical data to ensure their realistic values and mutual consistency. The model assumes that the emotional arousal over posts drives the agent's action. The simulations are preformed for the case of constant flux of agents and the results are analyzed in full analogy with the empirical data. The main conclusions are that the emotion-driven dynamics leads to long-range temporal correlations and emergent networks with community structure, that are comparable with the ones in the empirical system of popular posts. In view of pure emotion-driven agents actions, this type of comparisons provide a quantitative measure for the role of emotions in the dynamics on real blogs. Furthermore, the model reveals the underlying mechanisms which relate the post popularity with the emotion dynamics and the prevalence of negative emotions (critique). We also demonstrate how the community structure is tuned by varying a relevant parameter in the model. All data used in these works are fully anonymized. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   Methodology Sixty extracted single-rooted teeth were randomly divided into five groups for root-end filling with mineral trioxide aggregate, Super-EBA, TPH composite resin with ProBond dentine bonding agent, Dispersalloy amalgam with and without ProBond, and positive and negative control groups. Root canals were instrumented using the step-back technique and simulated root-end resections performed. Root-end filling materials were placed in 3 mm ultrasonic retro-preparations, Nail varnish was applied to all external root surfaces to the level of the resected root ends to prevent lateral microleakage. Samples were sterilized in an ethylene oxide sterilizer for 12 h. Using a newly designed model system, the apical 3-4 mm of the roots were immersed in BHI culture medium with phenol red indicator within culture chambers. The coronal access of each specimen was inoculated every 48 h with a suspension of Streptococcus salivarius. Culture media were observed every 24 h for colour change indicating bacterial contamination. Media demonstrating colour change were plated for S, salivarius. Samples were observed for 12 weeks.
   Results At 4 weeks 10 % of specimens from each experimental group had evidence of leakage. At 8 weeks 20 % of specimens filled with amalgam without dentine bonding agent, Super-EBA and MTA had evidence of leakage, At 12 weeks minor differences between materials were noted.
   Conclusions Under the conditions of the study, despite some variations, there were no statistically significant differences in rate of microleakage among the five groups tested at either 4, 8 or 12 weeks.

AB Noninvasive techniques tracking the transplanted stem cells played an important role in regenerative medicine and it remains significant to investigate the interference of contrast agents to the growth and differentiation of stem cells. The study investigate the effects of superparamagnetic iron oxide particles (SPIO) labeling on the rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and evaluate the feasibility of in vivo tracking with noninvasive MRI. Commercial Resovist was added to culture at different concentration equivalent to 14, 28, 56,112 mu g Fe/mL and without the contrast agents in the control group. The cytoxicity and labeling efficiency of SPIO labeling-BMSCs were determinate by MU assay and Prussian Blue staining, respectively. BMSCs of all groups were induced by DMSO and BHA for six hours, subsequently, the mRNA expressions of neuroepithelial stem cell protein (Nestin), neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), as well as nestin protein expression of BMSCs were examined by RT-PCT and western blot technique after differentiation. Compared with the control group, the expression of nestin, NSE and GFAP was positive in groups of different concentrations and without statistical significance, as well as nestin protein expression (P < 0.05). Besides, we used susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) to demonstrate the low signal intensity of BMSCs labeled by SPIO. Our results showed that efficient labeling of BMSCs at an optimized dosage of SPIO nanoparticles didn't affect the growth and differentiation properties of BMSCs. Simultaneously, the process of differentiation of SPIO labeled BMSCs can be detect in vivo by MRI which demonstrate that SPIO nanoparticles may enable noninvasive in vivo tracking of BMSCs in experimental and clinical settings during cell-based therapies.

AB This paper aims to upgrade the poro-mechanical scheme to simulate concrete volume change and damages which are strongly coupled with both alkali silica reaction (ASR) and freeze-thaw cycles (FTC). The interaction of two impacts are modeled by considering ASR gel intrusion and ice formation in micro pores and crack gaps, gel movement and unfrozen water suction into entrained air, gel and water migration through cracks as well as equilibrium and mass conservation of both concrete skeleton and mixed pore substances. For the assessment how the proposed numerical scheme works, sequence of events on ASR and FTC is focused on. It shows that ASR can reduce the FTC expansion for nonair- entrained (non-AE) case, but increase the frost damage for air-entrained (AE) concrete. Similarly, the FTC damaged concrete will have a smaller ASR expansion for non-AE case, but a greater expansion when AE admixture agent is dosed. The simulated behaviors also agree well with past experiments of combined ASR and FTC. Finally, the analysis on short-term strength shows that the ASR damaged concrete has a higher residual compressive strength and ductility rather than FTC damaged one due to viscous ASR gel which stand for broken symmetry of damage fields.

AB Background: Chlorhexidine is the gold standard of dental plaque prevention. The aim of the present study was to compare the plaque and gingivitis inhibiting effect of commercial products containing 0.2%, 0.12% and 0.06% chlorhexidine in a modified experimental gingivitis model.
   Methods: In three groups of healthy volunteers, experimental gingivitis was induced and monitored over 21 days and simultaneously treated with the commercial solutions containing 0.2%, 0.12% and 0.06% chlorhexidine. The maxillary right quadrant of each individual received mouthwash only, whereas the maxillary left quadrant was subject to both rinsing and mechanical oral hygiene. Compliance and side effects were monitored at days 7, 14, and 21. Plaque and gingivitis scores were obtained at baseline and day 21.
   Results: The commercial mouthwash containing 0.2% chlorhexidine resulted in statistically significantly lower plaque scores than the 0.12 and 0.06% mouthwashes after 21 days use, whereas no statistically significant difference was found between the effects of the two latter.
   Conclusion: A commercially available mouthwash containing 0.2% chlorhexidine had statistically significant better effect in preventing dental plaque than the 0.12% and 0.06% solutions.

ID CURE; FLOW; GATE; RESINS
AB Liquid composite molding (LCM) processes such as resin transfer molding (RTM) and vacuum assisted RTM (VARTM) are used to manufacture high quality and net-shape fiber reinforced composite parts. All LCM processes impregnate fiber preforms packed in a mold cavity with a thermoset resin. After the preform is fully saturated, the injection is discontinued bid the resin continues to cure. Once the curing step is complete, the part is de-molded. The resin has to be mixed with a curing agent to cure. Typically, the resin and the curing agent are mixed together in a pressure pot before the injection. This has several disadvantages, such as storage of large amounts of hazardous polymerizing resin, wastage, and cleaning of cured resin from the injection line. This paper proposes the implementation and calibration of an alternative to this technique. The approach is to mix the curing agent with the resin as the resin enters the mold through a separate system featuring two feed-lines. Such a system will enable one to maintain a uniform gel time throughout the part by varying the mixing ratio of resin and the catalyst during the injection. An experimental study of such on-line mixing to obtain simultaneous curing and to reduce the overall curing time is conducted and presented in this paper. Implementation of a control scheme that varies the curing agent during injection and its effect on cure time is benchmarked with the process in which the percentage of curing agent is held constant The gel time for the fabricated parts was reduced by 20-25% by continuously varying the percentage of curing agent during injection.

AB Vascularization of biomaterial scaffolds is essential for the successful clinical application of engineered tissues. Experimental studies are often performed to investigate the role of scaffold architecture on vascularized tissue formation. However, experiments are expensive and time-consuming and synthesis protocols often do not allow for independent investigation of specific scaffold properties. Computational models allow for rapid screening of potential material designs with control over scaffold properties that is difficult in laboratory settings. We have developed and tested a three-dimensional agent-based framework for investigating the effect of scaffold pore architecture on angiogenesis. Software agents represent endothelial cells, interacting together and with their micro-environment, leading to the invasion of blood vessels into the scaffold. A rule base, driven by experimental findings, governs the behavior of individual agents. 3D scaffold models with well-defined homogeneous and heterogeneous pore architectures were simulated to investigate the impact of various design parameters. Simulation results indicate that pores of larger size with higher interconnectivity and porosity support rapid and extensive angiogenesis. The developed framework can be used to screen biomaterial scaffold designs for optimal vascularization and investigate complex interactions among invading blood vessels and their micro-environment.

AB Call centre work was simulated in an experiment with 96 experienced call centre agents. The experimental design comprised two factors. First, agents communicated with customers either via phone, pc-videoconference or pc-videoconference with additional instructions increasing time pressure. The second experimental factor varied customer behaviour: half of the customers were friendly whereas the other half were rude. Several indicators of strain (e.g. emotional dissonance, tiredness) were assessed by self-reports. Moreover, the levels of immunoglobulin A (IgA) in salvia were determined at three sampling points and specific behaviours of agents (e.g. smiling to customers) were assessed using video data. It was found that unfriendly customer behaviour led to more strain and lower call performance than friendly customer behaviour. Inducing time pressure increased IgA-levels and reduced talking-time with customers. However, contrary to the expectations, the availability of video data did not enhance strain of agents. Instead, it was found that videoconferencing increased activation of agents if customers were friendly. Since higher levels of activation can counteract boredom and because customers often prefer to see their service providers, adding videoconference facilities in call centres seem to be a fruitful way of enriching routine call centre work.

AB In this paper, we apply an agent-based approach to explain both the final state and the dynamics of the development process of the wine sector in the Malopolska region in Poland. This sector has been affected by various environmental, institutional, behavioural and social factors and has undergone evolutionary changes in recent years. The econometric analysis of empirical data of vineyards in this region provides insights into the degree of influence of various factors under consideration on the aggregate number of vineyards in subregions. However, this does no explain the dynamics of the local formation of new vineyards or the underlying latent attitudes of vineyard owners. To overcome this limitation, we developed an agent-based model with heterogeneous agents (regular farms as well as large and small vineyards), which allowed us to identify a two-stage development scenario: i) community building and ii) vineyard creation. Our findings are of two types. Firstly, we showed a case where the agent-based model has good predictive power, in situations where the econometric model fails. Secondly, estimation of the agent-based model parameters and sensitivity analysis revealed crucial factors that have driven development of viticulture in the Malopolska region. In particular, we find that the crucial element underlying the good predictive power of the model is that it enables us to capture the fact that wine enthusiasts initially concentrate in sub-regions with more benign environmental conditions. Next, when one of them eventually established a vineyard, agents in the community had a lowered barrier to entry via the possibility of practical knowledge exchange, joint marketing efforts or vineyard maintenance resource sharing. This is in line with current evidence, which shows strong clustering effects, namely, a relatively large number of vineyards originate at relatively similar times and locations.

AB Information from others can be unreliable. Humans nevertheless act on such information, including gossip, to make various social calculations, thus raising the question of whether individuals can sort through social information to identify what is, in fact, true. Inspired by empirical literature on people's decision-making when considering gossip, we built an agent-based simulation model to examine how well simple decision rules could make sense of information as it propagated through a network. Our simulations revealed that a minimalistic decision-rule 'Bit-wise mode' - which compared information from multiple sources and then sought a consensus majority for each component bit within the message - was consistently the most successful at converging upon the truth. This decision rule attained high relative fitness even in maximally noisy networks, composed entirely of nodes that distorted the message. The rule was also superior to other decision rules regardless of its frequency in the population. Simulations carried out with variable agent memory constraints, different numbers of observers who initiated information propagation, and a variety of network types suggested that the single most important factor in making sense of information was the number of independent sources that agents could consult.

TI Emergence of Scale-Free Leadership Structure in Social Recommender

DT Article
ID FREE NETWORKS; DILEMMA
AB The study of the organization of social networks is important for the understanding of opinion formation, rumor spreading, and the emergence of trends and fashion. This paper reports empirical analysis of networks extracted from four leading sites with social functionality (Delicious, Flickr, Twitter and YouTube) and shows that they all display a scale-free leadership structure. To reproduce this feature, we propose an adaptive network model driven by social recommending. Artificial agent-based simulations of this model highlight a "good get richer" mechanism where users with broad interests and good judgments are likely to become popular leaders for the others. Simulations also indicate that the studied social recommendation mechanism can gradually improve the user experience by adapting to tastes of its users. Finally we outline implications for real online resource-sharing systems.

TI Copper-64 Dichloride as Theranostic Agent for Glioblastoma Multiforme: A
   Preclinical Study
SO BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
ID PET; RADIOMETALS
AB Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults with a median survival time less than one year. To date, there are only a limited number of effective agents available for GBM therapy and this does not seem to add much survival advantage over the conventional approach based on surgery and radiotherapy. Therefore, the development of novel therapeutic approaches to GBM is essential and those based on radionuclide therapy could be of significant clinical impact. Experimental evidence has clearly demonstrated that cancer cells have a particularly high fractional content of copper inside the nucleus compared to normal cells. This behavior can be conveniently exploited both for diagnosis and for delivering therapeutic payloads (theranostic) of the radionuclide copper-64 into the nucleus of cancerous cells by intravenous administration of its simplest chemical form as dichloride salt [Cu-64]CuCl2. To evaluate the potential theranostic role of [Cu-64]CuCl2 in GBM, the present work reports results from a preclinical study carried out in a xenografted GBM tumor mouse model. Biodistribution data of this new agent were collected using a small-animal PET tomograph. Subsequently, groups of tumor implanted nude mice were treated with [Cu-64]CuCl2 to simulate single-and multiple-dose therapy protocols, and results were analyzed to estimate therapeutic efficacy.

AB Background. Studies have reported commercially available essential oils with convincing plaque and gingivitis preventing properties. However, no tests have compared these essential oils, i.e. Listerine (R), against their true vehicle controls. Objective. To compare the plaque and gingivitis inhibiting effect of a commercially-available essential oil (Listerine (R) Total Care) to a negative (22% hydro-alcohol solution) and a positive (0.2% chlorhexidine (CHX)) control in an experimental gingivitis model. Materials and methods. In three groups of 15 healthy volunteers, experimental gingivitis was induced and monitored over 21 days, simultaneously treated with Listerine (R) Total Care (test), 22% hydro-alcohol solution (negative control) and 0.2% chlorhexidine solution (positive control), respectively. The upper right quadrant of each individual received mouthwash only, whereas the upper left quadrant was subject to both rinses and mechanical oral hygiene. Plaque, gingivitis and side-effects were assessed at day 7, 14 and 21. Results. After 21 days, the chlorhexidine group showed significantly lower average plaque and gingivitis scores than the Listerine (R) and alcohol groups, whereas there was little difference between the two latter. Conclusion. Listerine (R) Total Care had no statistically significant effect on plaque formation as compared to its vehicle control.

AB Simple Summary
   The high protein requirement in the diet of mink is currently met using extruded cereals, meat and bone meal, which raises the cost of mink farming. At the same time, there are waste products that may contain many infectious agents. Therefore, there is a need to look for high-protein feeds with properties stabilizing the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Fermented rapeseed meal (FRSM) may prove to be such a material. During the fermentation process, rapeseed loses the anti-nutritional substances contained in it, while acquiring new properties of a bioproduct. A study was carried out in mink to determine how FRSM in the diet modifies the population of microorganisms inhabiting the GIT and stabilizes its microbiota. FRSM was included in the feed of experimental animals, and changes in the population size of groups of intestinal microorganisms were analysed in relation to the control group receiving standard feed. Microbiological analyses were performed on faeces samples and from intestinal contents collected after the animals had been euthanized. The paper presents the effect of supplementation with FRSM obtained using biotechnological methods and demonstrates that it can be used in animal diets as a bioproduct influencing the gastrointestinal microbiota.
   Fermented rapeseed meal (FRSM) was used in the diet of American mink (Neovison vison). An advantage of this product is its prebiotic and functional properties, which can modify the bacterial microbiota of the GIT. A control group and three experimental groups were formed, with 60 animals in each group. The control group received a basal diet and the experimental groups received a diet with a 2%, 4% or 6% of FRSM as a replacement of extruded wheat. Bacillus subtilis strain 87Y was used to ferment the rapeseed meal (RSM). The study was conducted on mink from the age of 16-17 weeks until slaughter. Changes in the microbiota were analysed in samples of the animals' faeces and intestinal contents. The analyses included determination of the total number of bacteria and fungi, the number of coliforms and Escherichia coli, the total number of anaerobic Clostridium perfringens, and the presence of Salmonella spp. In animals receiving 4% and 6% FRSM (groups II and III), the content of microscopic fungi and the number of C. perfringens bacteria was significantly (p <= 0.05) lower than in the animals from the control group (group 0). A decrease in E. coli was observed in all experimental groups (I, II and III), although these differences were not statistically significant. The inclusion of FRSM in the feed ration did not affect the number of lactic acid intestinal bacteria. Analysis of the results obtained from the stool samples showed that the inclusion of FRSM in the ration did not significantly affect the number of microorganisms in each group. However, as in the case of the intestinal contents, in these samples there was a decrease in the total number of C. perfringens in the experimental groups (I, II and III), with a simultaneous increase in the number of mesophilic bacteria in relation to the control. There was no detection of Salmonella bacteria in any of the analysed material.

AB This paper presents a model-based analysis of the introduction of green products, which are products with low environmental impacts. Both consumers and firms are simulated as populations of agents who differ in their behavioural characteristics. Model experiments illustrate the influence of behavioural characteristics on the success of switching to green consumption. The model reproduces empirical observed stylised facts and shows the importance of social processing and status seeking in diffusion processes. The flexibility of firms to adapt to new technology is found to have an important influence on the type of consumers who change their consumption to green products in the early phase of the diffusion process.

AB Background We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to verify the hypothesis that intranasal dexmedetomidine premedication can reduce the minimum alveolar concentration of sevoflurane for laryngeal mask airway insertion in children.
   Methods Ninety American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I subjects, aged 3-7years, were randomized to three equal groups to receive saline (Group S), dexmedetomidine 1 mu g.kg(-1) (Group D-1), or dexmedetomidine 2 mu g.kg(-1) (Group D-2) approximately 45 min before anesthesia. The minimum alveolar concentration for laryngeal mask airway insertion of sevoflurane was determined according to the Dixon's up-and-down method. Emergence delirium was evaluated using the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU).
   Results Dexmedetomidine premedication of 1 and 2 mu g.kg(-1) was associated with reduction in sevoflurane from 1.92% to 1.53% and 1.23%, corresponding to decrease of 20% and 36%, respectively. The peak PAED scores (median [IQR]) were 9 [8-11.5], 5 [3-5.3], and 3 [2-4] in Group S, Group D-1,D- and Group D-2, respectively. The incidence of emergence delirium (defined as peak PAED score 10) was significantly lower in Groups D-1 and D-2 than in Group S (P<0.001). Simultaneously, the induction qualities and the parent's satisfaction scores were significantly higher in Groups D-1 and D-2 than in Group S (P<0.001).
   Conclusion Intranasal dexmedetomidine premedication produces a dose-dependent decrease in the minimum alveolar concentration for laryngeal mask airway insertion of sevoflurane and emergence delirium in the PACU.

AB In many network data sets, the outcomes of interest are equal to zero for some agents and strictly positive for others. They can be analyzed by Tobit models with social interactions with different assumptions on information structures. Under complete information, all the observables and unobservables are publicly known. Under incomplete information, unobservables and some covariates collected by econometricians can be private information for agents. In practice, both scenarios can be feasible but will lead to different implications. A non-nested Cox-type test is proposed for the specification test. We use the Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate its small sample properties. When applying our test to study property tax rates among adjacent municipalities in North Carolina, significant competing effects are found under both information structures. However, the Cox test is in favor of the complete information model, which implies a much larger income marginal effects and a much smaller population marginal effects on tax rates, compared to the model with incomplete information.

AB The sustainability of water resources depends on the dynamic interactions among the environmental, technological, and social characteristics of the water system and local population. These interactions can cause supply-demand imbalances at diverse temporal scales, and the response of consumers to water use regulations impacts future water availability. This research develops a dynamic modeling approach to simulate supply-demand dynamics using an agent-based modeling framework that couple models of consumers and utility managers with water system models. Households are represented as agents, and their water use behaviors are represented as rules. A water utility manager agent enacts water use restrictions, based on fluctuations in the reservoir water storage. Water balance in a reservoir is simulated, and multiple climate scenarios are used to test the sensitivity of water availability to changes in streamflow, precipitation, and temperature. The framework is applied to the water supply system in Raleigh, North Carolina to assess sustainability of drought management plans. Model accuracy is assessed using statistical metrics, and sustainability is calculated for a projected period as the satisfaction or deficit of meeting municipal demands. Multiple climate change scenarios are created by perturbing average monthly values of historical inflow, precipitation, and evapotranspiration data. Results demonstrate the use of the agent-based modeling approach to project the effectiveness of management policies and recommend drought policies for improving the sustainability of urban water resources.

AB This paper studied the distributed optimal frequency regulation for multiple power generations in an isolated microgrid under limited communication resource. The event-triggered mechanism is introduced in the construction of the regulation algorithm. Each power generation in the microgrid only transmits its own information to its neighbors through a communication network when the event-triggered condition is satisfied, and the communication burden can be reduced significantly. Moreover, Zeno behavior is excluded to make the event-triggered regulation algorithm reasonable and realistic for practical microgrids. The proposed regulation method can restore the frequency and retain the economic efficiency simultaneously when some disturbances occur in isolated microgrids. The experimental result shows the effectiveness of the theoretical method.

TI Norm violation versus punishment risk in a social model of corruption
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
LA English
DT Article
ID GAMES
AB We analyze the onset of social-norm-violating behaviors when social punishment is present. To this aim, a compartmental model is introduced to illustrate the flows among the three possible states: honest, corrupt, and ostracism. With this simple model we attempt to capture some essential ingredients such as the contagion of corrupt behaviors to honest agents, the delation of corrupt individuals by honest ones, and the warning to wrongdoers (fear like that triggers the conversion of corrupt people into honesty). In nonequilibrium statistical physics terms, the former dynamics can be viewed as a non-Hamiltonian kinetic spin-1 Ising model. After developing in full detail its mean-field theory and comparing its predictions with simulations made on regular networks, we derive the conditions for the emergence of corrupt behaviors and, more importantly, illustrate the key role of the warning-to-wrongdoers mechanism in the latter.

AB This study aims to investigate the interaction mechanism of a hypoglycemic agent, trelagliptin (UN, and human serum albumin (HSA) through computer simulation and assisted spectroscopy methods. Computer simulation including molecular docking and molecular dynamics analysis was conducted under physiological conditions. Molecular docking results indicate that TLP bound to HSA at site I, and the binding behavior was mainly governed by hydrophobic force. Competitive experiments further verified the theoretical conclusion from molecular docking. Molecular dynamics simulation revealed that TLP indeed stably bound to site I of HSA in the hydrophobic subdomain IIA. Moreover, TLP presented a certain effect on the structural compactness of HSA. In molecular dynamics simulation, hydrogen bonds appeared, which suggested the reliability and stability of the combination. The binding energy of the stable phase is around -250 kJ/mol. Fluorescence quenching studies and time-resolved fluorescence analysis indicated that the evident fluorescence quenching phenomenon of HSA could be due to TLP binding initiated by static quenching mechanism. The binding constants (K-a) of the complex were found to be around 10(4) via fluorescence data, and the calculated thermodynamic parameters indicated that hydrophobic force played major role in the binding of TLP to HSA. Synchronous fluorescence and three-dimensional fluorescence results demonstrated that TLP slightly disturbed the microenvironment of amino residues. Circular dichroism spectra showed that TLP affected the secondary structure of HSA. The theoretical and experimental results showed excellent agreement. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We propose a model of mobile agents to study the epidemic spreading in communities with different densities of agents, which aims to simulate the realistic situation of multiple cities. The model addresses the epidemic process from a community with threshold lambda(c1) less than the infection rate lambda to a community with threshold lambda(c2) larger than lambda through both direct and indirect contacts. By both theoretic analysis and numerical simulations we show that it is possible to sustain the epidemic spreading in the community with lambda(c2) through contact with another community, provided that the latter is connected with an infected community. This result suggests that for effectively controlling the epidemic spread, we should also pay attention to the risk caused by the infection through indirect contact. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB We use topological data analysis and machine learning to study a seminal model of collective motion in biology [M. R. D'Orsogna et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 104302 (2006)]. This model describes agents interacting nonlinearly via attractive-repulsive social forces and gives rise to collective behaviors such as flocking and milling. To classify the emergent collective motion in a large library of numerical simulations and to recover model parameters from the simulation data, we apply machine learning techniques to two different types of input. First, we input time series of order parameters traditionally used in studies of collective motion. Second, we input measures based on topology that summarize the time-varying persistent homology of simulation data over multiple scales. This topological approach does not require prior knowledge of the expected patterns. For both unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods, the topological approach outperforms the one that is based on traditional order parameters. (C) 2019 Author(s).

AB Infectious disease plays a major role in the lives of wild primates, and the past decade has witnessed significant strides in our understanding of primate disease ecology. In this review, I briefly describe some key findings from phylogenetic comparative approaches, focusing on analyses of parasite richness that use the Global Mammal Parasite Database. While these studies have provided new answers to fundamental questions, new questions have arisen, including questions about the underlying epidemiological mechanisms that produce the broader phylogenetic patterns. I discuss two examples in which theoretical models have given us new traction on these comparative questions. First, drawing on findings of a positive association between range use intensity and the richness of helminth parasites, we developed a spatially explicit agent-based model to investigate the underlying drivers of this pattern. From this model, we are gaining deeper understanding of how range use intensity results in greater exposure to parasites, thus producing higher prevalence in the simulated populationsand, plausibly, higher parasite richness in comparative analyses. Second, I show how a model of disease spread on social networks provides solid theoretical foundations for understanding the effects of sociality and group size on parasitism across primate species. This study further revealed that larger social groups are more subdivided, which should slow the spread of infectious diseases. This effect could offset the increased disease risk expected in larger social groups, which has yet to receive strong empirical support in our comparative analyses. In addition to these examples, I discuss the need for more meta-analyses of individual-level phenomena documented in the field, and for greater linkage between theoretical modeling and field research.

AB We specify an "individual-based" continuous-time model for swarm aggregation in n-dimensional Euclidean space. We show that the swarm is completely stable, and the center of the swarm is stationary. Numerical simulations indicate that the individuals will form a stable and cohesive swarm, and under the attraction/repulsion function, the bound of the swarm size will increase as the number of individuals increases.

AB We introduce and investigate by numerical simulations a number of models of emotional agents at the square lattice. Our models describe the most general features of emotions such as the spontaneous emotional arousal, emotional relaxation, and transfers of emotions between different agents. Group emotions in the considered models are periodically fluctuating between two opposite valency levels and as result the mean value of such group emotions is zero. The oscillations amplitude depends strongly on probability p(s) of the individual spontaneous arousal. For small values of relaxation times tau we observed a stochastic resonance, i.e. the signal to noise ratio SNR is maximal for a non-zero p(s) parameter. The amplitude increases with the probability p of local affective interactions while the mean oscillations period increases with the relaxation time tau and is only weakly dependent on other system parameters. Presence of emotional antenna can enhance positive or negative emotions and for the optimal transition probability the antenna can change agents emotions at longer distances. The stochastic resonance was also observed for the influence of emotions on task execution efficiency.

AB This paper studies prototypical strategies to sequentially aggregate independent decisions. We consider a collection of agents, each performing binary hypothesis testing and each obtaining a decision over time. We assume the agents are identical and receive independent information. Individual decisions are sequentially aggregated via a threshold-based rule. In other words, a collective decision is taken as soon as a specified number of agents report a concordant decision (simultaneous discordant decisions and no-decision outcomes are also handled). We obtain the following results. First, we characterize the probabilities of correct and wrong decisions as a function of time, group size, and decision threshold. The computational requirements of our approach are linear in the group size. Second, we consider the so-called fastest and majority rules, corresponding to specific decision thresholds. For these rules, we provide a comprehensive scalability analysis of both accuracy and decision time. In the limit of large group sizes, we show that the decision time for the fastest rule converges to the earliest possible individual time, and that the decision accuracy for the majority rule shows an exponential improvement over the individual accuracy. Additionally, via a theoretical and numerical analysis, we characterize various speed/accuracy tradeoffs. Finally, we relate our results to some recent observations reported in the cognitive information processing (CIP) literature.

AB The archaeological record has been described as a key to the long-term consequences of human action that can help guide our decisions today. Yet the sparse and incomplete nature of this record often makes it impossible to inferentially reconstruct past societies in sufficient detail for them to serve as more than very general cautionary tales of coupled socio-ecological systems. However, when formal and computational modeling is used to experimentally simulate human socioecological dynamics, the empirical archaeological record can be used to validate and improve dynamic models of long term change. In this way, knowledge generated by archaeology can play a unique and valuable role in developing the tools to make more informed decisions that will shape our future. The Mediterranean Landscape Dynamics project offers an example of using the past to develop and test computational models of interactions between land-use and landscape evolution that ultimately may help guide decision-making.

AB So far, there has been no conclusion on the mechanism for herding, which is often discussed in the academia. Assuming escaping behavior of individuals in emergency is rational rather than out of panic according to recent findings in social psychology, we investigate the behavioral evolution of large crowds from the perspective of evolutionary game theory. Specifically, evolution of the whole population divided into two subpopulations, namely the co-evolution of strategy and game structure, is numerically simulated based on the game theoretical models built and the evolutionary rule designed, and a series of phenomena including extinction of one subpopulation and herding effect are predicted in the proposed framework. Furthermore, if the rewarding for rational agents becomes significantly larger than that for emotional ones, herding effect will disappear. It is exciting that some phase transition points with interesting properties for the system can be found. In addition, our model framework is able to explain the fact that it is difficult for mavericks to prevail in society. The current results of this work will be helpful in understanding and restraining herding effect in real life. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a novel decentralized control strategy for bilaterally teleoperating heterogeneous groups of mobile robots from different domains (aerial, ground, marine, and underwater) is proposed. By using a decentralized control architecture, the group of robots, which is treated as the slave side, is made able to navigate in a cluttered environment while avoiding obstacles, interrobot collisions, and following the human motion commands. Simultaneously, the human operator acting on the master side is provided with a suitable force feedback informative of the group response and of the interaction with the surrounding environment. Using passivity-based techniques, we allow the behavior of the group to be as flexible as possible with arbitrary split and join events (e.g., due to interrobot visibility/packet losses or specific task requirements) while guaranteeing the stability of the system. We provide a rigorous analysis of the system stability and steady-state characteristics and validate performance through human/hardware-in-the-loop simulations by considering a heterogeneous fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles as a case study. Finally, we also provide an experimental validation with four quadrotor UAVs.

DE Applied probability; Call centers; Service times; Agent heterogeneity;

AB Traditionally, both researchers and practitioners rely on standard Erlang queueing models to analyze call center operations. Going beyond such simple models has strong implications, as is evidenced by theoretical advances in the recent literature. However, there is very little empirical research to support that body of theoretical work. In this paper, we carry out a large-scale data-based investigation of service times in a call center with many heterogeneous agents and multiple call types. We observe that, for a given call type: (a) the service-time distribution depends strongly on the individual agent, (b) that it changes with time, and (c) that average service times are correlated across successive days or weeks. We develop stochastic models that account for these facts. We compare our models to simpler ones, commonly used in practice, and find that our proposed models have a better goodness-of-fit, both in-sample and out-of-sample. We also perform simulation experiments to show that the choice of model can have a significant impact on the estimates of common measures of quality of service in the call center.

AB Acrocomia aculeata is a plant rich in antioxidant compounds. Studies suggest that this plant has anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, and diuretic potential. We assessed the antigenotoxic, antimutagenic, immunomodulation, and apoptotic potentials of A. aculeata alone and in combination with an antitumor agent, cyclophosphamide. Swiss male mice (N = 140) were used. The animals were divided into 14 experimental groups as follows: a negative group, a positive group (100 mg/kg cyclophosphamide), groups that only received the oil extracted from the almond (AO) and from the pulp (PO) of A. aculeata at doses of 3, 15, and 30 mg/kg, and the associated treatment groups (oils combined with cyclophosphamide) involving pretreatment, simultaneous, and post-treatment protocols. Data suggest that both oils were chemopreventive at all doses, based on the tested protocols. The highest damage reduction percentages, observed for AO and PO were 88.19 and 90.03%, respectively, for the comet assay and 69.73 and 70.93%, respectively, for the micronucleus assay. Both AO and PO demonstrated immunomodulatory activity. The oils reduced the capacity of cyclophosphamide to trigger apoptosis in the liver, spleen, and kidney cells. These results suggest that A. aculeate AO and PO can be classified as a functional food and also enrich other functional foods and nutraceuticals with chemopreventive features. However, they are not appropriate sources for chemotherapeutic adjuvants, in particular for those used in combination with cyclophosphamide.

AB This study evaluated the influence of silver nanoparticles (NAg) incorporated into the primer of a three-step adhesive system (Scotch-Bond Multi-purpose) over the composite-resin colour (CIELab and CIEDE 2000) as a function of the concentration and ageing methods. Ninety specimens were prepared and distributed into 6 groups (n 1/4 15), according to the NAg concentration: NAg 0 (0 wt%); NAg 50 (0.005 wt%); NAg 100 (0.010 wt%); NAg 150 (0.015 wt%); NAg 200 (0.020 wt%); NAg 250 (0.025 wt%). Initial colour readings were performed to evaluate colour change (CC) after NAg addition to primers. Readings after 30 days of storage in water (30D), thermocycling (TC), and accelerated artificial ageing (AAA) were performed to verify the influence of each method over CC. Data was calculated according to CIELab and CIEDE 2000 systems and analysed with one-way and two-way ANOVA (p <= 0.05), complemented with post-hoc Tukey test. Data presented normality, homoscedasticity, and statistical difference. Delta Es gradually increased according to the percentage of added NAg into the primer. Thermocycling and UV light exposure induced a higher colour change when compared to water ageing (D30). Significant statistical difference was found for all ageing methods. CIEDE 2000 and CIELab are similar methods of colour evaluation. Besides, primers with up to 0.025 wt% applied in cavities deeper than 1 mm were colour-safe and did not jeopardise the aesthetic perception of the simulated restoration.

AB In the current investigation, the molecular structure of the anticonvulsant agent (2E)-2-[3-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)-1-phenylpropylidene]-N-phenylhydrazinecarboxamide ((2E)-HIPC) was theoretically modelled using ab initio Hartree-Fock (HF) and density functional theory (DFT/B3LYP) calculations. The Fourier transform (FT) infrared and FT-Raman spectra of (2E)-HIPC were also recorded, and the observed bands were assigned to the vibrational normal modes. The main functional groups were identified via vibrational analysis, and their absorption bands were assigned. A comparative analysis was performed for the computed and experimental results. Subtle differences were observed between the calculated and experimental UV-Vis spectra. Time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) excitation energies were calculated for five excited electronic states. The calculations were applied to simulate the spectra of (2E)-HIPC, and these simulated spectra exhibited excellent agreement with the experimental spectra. The DFT/B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) method, after scaling, exhibited better agreement with the experimental values than the results obtained by the HF method. The energy, oscillator strength, and wavelength computed by TD-DFT (IEFPCM) are consistent with the experimental results. The molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) and frontier molecular orbitals (HOMO-LUMO) were also determined to enable prediction of the structural changes and reactive sites. Mulliken population charges of the title molecule were also calculated in the gas phase. The NMR chemical shifts (C-13 and H-1) were calculated using the gauge-including atomic orbital method and the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) approach and were compared with the experimental values.

TI Where Does Theory Have It Right? A Comparison of Theory-Driven and

SO JASSS-THE JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL SOCIETIES AND SOCIAL SIMULATION
LA English
DT Article

   Development; Theoretical Vs. Empirical Models; Organic Food
AB Computational social science has witnessed a shift from pure theoretical to empirical agent-based models (ABMs) grounded in data-driven correlations between behavioral factors defining agents' decisions. There is a strong urge to go beyond theoretical ABMs with behavioral theories setting stylized rules that guide agents' actions, especially when it concerns policy-related simulations. However, it remains unclear to what extent theory-driven ABMs mislead, if at all, a choice of a policy when compared to the outcomes of models with empirical micro-foundations. This is especially relevant for pro-environmental policies that increasingly rely on quantifying cumulative effects of individual behavioral changes, where ABMs are so helpful. We propose a comparison framework to address this methodological dilemma, which quantitatively explores the gap in predictions between theory- and data-driven ABMs. Inspired by the existing theory-driven model, ORVin-T, which studies the individual choice between organic and conventional products, we design a survey to collect data on individual preferences and purchasing decisions. We then use this extensive empirical microdata to build an empirical twin, ORVin-E, replacing the theoretical assumptions and secondary aggregated data used to parametrize agents' decision strategies with our empirical survey data. We compare the models in terms of key outputs, perform sensitivity analysis, and explore three policy scenarios. We observe that the theory-driven model predicts the shifts to organic consumption as accurately as the ABM with empirical micro-foundations at both aggregated and individual scales. There are slight differences (similar to 5%) between the estimations of the two models with regard to different behavioral change scenarios: increasing conventional tax, launching organic social-informational campaigns, and their combination. Our findings highlight the goodness of fit and usefulness of theoretical modeling efforts, at least in the case of incremental behavioral change. It sheds light on the conditions when theory-driven and data-driven models are aligned and on the value of empirical data for studying systemic changes.

AB We consider the coupled dynamics of the adaption of network structure and the evolution of strategies played by individuals occupying the network vertices. We propose a computational model in which each agent plays a n-round Prisoner's Dilemma game with its immediate neighbors, after that, based upon self-interest, partial individuals may punish their defective neighbors by dismissing the social tie to the one who defects the most times, meanwhile seek for a new partner at random from the neighbors of the punished agent. It is found that the promotion of cooperation is attributed to the entangled evolution of individual strategy and network structure. Moreover, we show that the emerging social networks exhibit high heterogeneity and disassortative mixing pattern. For a given average connectivity of the population and the number of rounds, there is a critical value for the fraction of individuals adapting their social interactions, above which cooperators wipe out defectors. Besides, the effects of the average degree, the number of rounds, and the intensity of selection are investigated by extensive numerical simulations. Our results to some extent reflect the underlying mechanism promoting cooperation. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Purpose: Explore whether agent-based modeling and simulation can help healthcare administrators discover interventions that increase population wellness and quality of care while, simultaneously, decreasing costs. Since important dynamics often lie in the social determinants outside the health facilities that provide services, this study thus models the problem at three levels (individuals, organizations, and society).
   Methods: The study explores the utility of translating an existing (prize winning) software for modeling complex societal systems and agent's daily life activities (like a Sim City style of software), into a desired decision support system. A case study tests if the 3 levels of system modeling approach is feasible, valid, and useful. The case study involves an urban population with serious mental health and Philadelphia's Medicaid population (n = 527,056), in particular.
   Results: Section 3 explains the models using data from the case study and thereby establishes feasibility of the approach for modeling a real system. The models were trained and tuned using national epidemiologic datasets and various domain expert inputs. To avoid co-mingling of training and testing data, the simulations were then run and compared (Section 4.1) to an analysis of 250,000 Philadelphia patient hospital admissions for the year 2010 in terms of re-hospitalization rate, number of doctor visits, and days in hospital. Based on the Student t-test, deviations between simulated vs. real world outcomes are not statistically significant. Validity is thus established for the 2008-2010 timeframe. We computed models of various types of interventions that were ineffective as well as 4 categories of interventions (e.g., reduced per-nurse caseload, increased check-ins and stays, etc.) that result in improvement in well-being and cost.
   Conclusions: The 3 level approach appears to be useful to help health administrators sort through system complexities to find effective interventions at lower costs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB BackgroundIncome inequalities in sports participation are shaped by a system in which individuals and the environment interact. We developed an agent-based model (ABM) that could represent this system and used it to provide a proof-of-concept of its potential to explore the impact of individual and environmental interventions on reducing inequalities in sports participation.MethodsOur ABM simulates sports participation of individuals in the Dutch city of Eindhoven. In the model, sports participation is determined by an individual's tendency to start sports (at a fitness center, sports club or self-organized), which is influenced by attributes of individuals (i.e. age, sex, income), sports facilities (i.e. price, accessibility) and the social environment (i.e. social cohesion, social influence). Sports facilities can adapt to changes in the demand by closures or startups, which in turn influence the tendency of individuals to participate in sport. We explored the impact of five interventions scenarios.ResultsExplorative results show that providing health education, increasing the availability of sports facilities, lowering prices of facilities and improving safety levels can increase sports participation and modestly reduce absolute income inequalities in sports participation. The largest gain can be attained through health education, if the effect and reach is sufficiently large. Environmental interventions alone have a modest impact. Marked effects are only achieved after five to 10 years.ConclusionsABMs have much potential to test the population-level effects of various interventions in the context of a system. Our study highlights the challenges of ABM development and reveals gaps in empirical data. With further refinements, our model could aid in understanding and finding optimal pathways to reduce income inequalities in sports participation.

AB Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of four in-office desensitizing products on dentin tubule occlusion and erosive wear.
   Methods: Dentin hypersensitivity was simulated by EDTA application for five minutes. The specimens were randomly allocated into five groups (n= 11), according to treatment: No treatment - ontrol (C), Duraphat (DUR), Desensibilize Nano P (NP), ClinPro XT Varnish (XTV), and ClinPro White Varnish (CWV). They were then submitted to erosive/abrasive cycling for five days. After EDTA, treatment, and cycling, the specimens were analyzed with an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) to verify the number of opened dentin tubules (ODT) which were counted by using ImageJ software, and with a profilometer to determine the surface curvature/loss. ESEM data were analyzed with two-way repeated measure analysis of variance and Tukey tests. For the profilometer, data were analyzed with Kruskal-Wallis, Tukey, and Mann-Whitney tests.
   Results: After treatment, all groups showed lower ODT than the control, without significant differences between them. After cycling, the only group that showed lower ODT than the control was group XTV; however, it did not significantly differ from the other groups. For the profilometric analysis, there were significant differences in SL between the experimental times after treatment and after cycling for all groups (p<.05). After cycling, no surface loss was detected in groups DUR and XTV, which presented a significantly different curvature than group NP and the control group, but not from group CWV. Surface loss was detected for the control and groups NP and CWV, without difference among them.
   Conclusion: All desensitizing agents tested presented promising results concerning the obliteration of dentin tubules immediately after treatment. XTV was the only desensitizer capable of preventing the reopening of the tubules after the erosive/abrasive challenges. XTV and DUR presented a protective effect against dentin erosive wear.

AB The history of the discovery of the renin-angiotensin system began in 1898 with the studies made by Tigerstedt and Bergman, who reported the pressor effect of renal extracts; they named the renal substance renin based on its origin. In 1934, Harry Goldblatt induced experimental hypertension in dogs by clamping a renal artery. About 1936, simultaneously in the Medical School of the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina, and in the Eli-Lilly Laboratories in Indianapolis, 2 independent groups of researchers, using the Goldblatt technique to produce experimental hypertension, demonstrated renal secretion of a pressor agent similar to renin. In the following years, both teams described the presence of a new compound in the renal vein blood of ischemic kidneys. This agent was extracted from blood with 70% acetone and had a short pressor effect. The final conclusion was that renin acted enzymatically on a plasma protein to produce the new substance. In Buenos Aires, it was called hypertensin; in the United States, angiotonin. In 1958, Eduardo Braun Menendez from Argentina and Irving H. Page from the United States agreed to name it angiotensin.

AB We have analyzed a set of 39 mutational spectra of the supF gene that were generated by different mutagenic agents and under different experimental conditions. The cluster analyses was performed using a newly developed clustering procedure. The clustering criterion used in the procedure was developed by applying the classification likelihood approach to multinomial observations. We also developed a Gibbs sampling-based optimization procedure that outperformed previously developed methods in a comparative simulation study. The results of the cluster analysis showed that our clustering procedure was able to recreate natural grouping of the mutational spectra with respect to the characteristics of mutagenic agents used to generate them and with respect to experimental conditions applied in the process of generating spectra. These results are an important confirmation of the relevance of mutational spectra in characterizing mutagenic mechanisms of different carcinogens.

AB This paper reports on an Agent-Based Model. The purpose of developing this model is to describe 'the uptake of low carbon and energy efficient technologies and practices by households and under different interventions'. There is a particular focus on modelling non-financial incentives as well as the influence of social networks as well as the decision making by multiple types of agents in interaction, i.e. recommending agents and sales agents, not just households. The decision making model for householder agents is inspired by the Consumat approach, as well as some of those recently applied to electric vehicles. A feature that differentiates this model is that it also represents information agents that provide recommendations and sales agents that proactively sell energy efficient products. By applying the model to a number of scenarios with policies aimed at increasing the adoption of solar hot water systems, a range of questions are explored, including whether it is more effective to incentivise sales agents to promote solar hot water systems, or whether it is more effective to provide a subsidy directly to households; or in fact whether it is better to work with plumbers so that they can promote these systems. The resultant model should be viewed as a conceptual structure with a theoretical and empirical grounding, but which requires further data collection for rigorous analysis of policy options.

AB This paper studies a robust connectivity preserving rendezvous problem for a leader-following multirobot system. Only a small group of mobile robots is informed to have access to the leader's information. A distributed, robust, dynamic, control law is proposed such that connectivity-preserving rendezvous is achieved regardless of the unknown nonlinear dynamics and disturbances. Although the multirobot network has a dynamic network topology, the developed controller is able to maintain the connectivity of an initially connected communication network. Using the tools from algebraic graph theory, Lyapunov method, and nonsmooth analysis, sufficient conditions on the asymptotic convergence of the closed-loop multirobot systems are derived. A numerical example and simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB This paper presents a model for simulating realistic crowd behaviors at low computation cost. The proposed model is inspired by video data. In our approach, we first classify the crowd into two categories: main and background characters. Whether the agents are main characters or not is influenced by two factors, one is the agent's trajectories and the other one is the change of the environment. In the second stage, we adopt two approaches to simulate the behaviors of main and background characters. Main characters are intelligent agents with the perception, the memory, the planning, and the psychology so that they can make decisions themselves. Background characters are informed of the behavior options for execution by the smart environment. Finally, we simulate the road-crossing scenario in a three-dimensional virtual environment. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach not only well reflects the characteristics of agent behaviors but also reduces the computation complexity of simulating realistic crowd.

AB While the acquisition of knowledge about the sensory, emotional, and motor states of others has long been thought to derive from abstract inferential operations, recent theories based on neuroscientific and psychological models emphasize that motor simulation is essential to a variety of complex functions ranging from the monitoring of one's own performance to the understanding of others' actions, and matching self and others' states to optimize social interactions. In this review, we discuss evidence that simulating the actions of others has both bright and dark sides. On the one hand, we show that simulation can aid the anticipation and prediction of errors in the actions of others (e.g., in the case of competitive sports), as well as the establishment of social bonds (e.g., in the case of mimicry). On the other hand, based on findings from our and other research groups, we describe specific circumstances in which simulating the actions of others is detrimental to performance (e.g., when we automatically follow the gaze of a person who is actually trying to deceive us). Finally, we show how the presence of a shared goal between agents (such as in joint actions) maximizes the cost benefit of motor simulation, suggesting that the top-down modulation of this process is vital for adapting in a social environment.

This paper addresses the development of a framework and robot controllers that enable a group of aerial robots to maintain a formation with partial state information while avoiding collisions. The central concept is to develop a low-dimensional abstraction of the large teams of robots, facilitate planning, command, and control in a low-dimensional space, and to realize commands or plans in the abstract space by synthesizing controllers for individual robots that respect the specified abstraction. We derive the basic theory and present experimental and simulation results with a team of rotor crafts.

DE Cryptocurrency; Bitcoin; Inverse Reinforcement Lerning; Agent-Based
   Modeling
AB In this paper, we present a novel method to predict Bitcoin price movement utilizing inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) and agent-based modeling (ABM). Our approach consists of predicting the price through reproducing synthetic yet realistic behaviors of rational agents in a simulated market, instead of estimating relationships between the price and price-related factors. IRL provides a systematic way to find the behavioral rules of each agent from Blockchain data by framing the trading behavior estimation as a problem of recovering motivations from observed behavior and generating rules consistent with these motivations. Once the rules are recovered, an agent-based model creates hypothetical interactions between the recovered behavioral rules, discovering equilibrium prices as emergent features through matching the supply and demand of Bitcoin. One distinct aspect of our approach with ABM is that while conventional approaches manually design individual rules, our agents' rules are channeled from IRL. Our experimental results show that the proposed method can predict short-term market price while outlining overall market trend.

AB When do more severe punishments not deter crimes and when are stronger incentives for control personnel ineffective to motive control? This contribution shows when incentives for crime control have paradoxical effects. It follows from game theoretical reasoning that the opposed interests between criminals and inspectors lead to strategies where both seek to outsmart each other. If both do so, ego's incentives only affect alter's behavior. This strategic incentive effect implies that higher punishments do not cause fewer crimes, but fewer inspections. This was experimentally corroborated by Rauhut in 2009. The second implication is that stronger inspection incentives do not cause more inspections, but fewer crimes. This paper studies the second implication under farsighted strategic actors, shows its robustness by agent-based simulations of backward-looking learning and provides experimental evidence. In the laboratory experiment, 200 subjects were partitioned into citizens who could steal money from each other and inspectors who could invest in inspection to detect criminal citizens. Results confirm that stronger inspection incentives cause less crime. However, actors are less strategic than predicted: stronger inspection incentives also cause more inspections. This is discussed by differentiating between the strategic incentive-effect, where ego's incentives only affect alter's behavior and the own incentive-effect, where ego's incentives also affect ego's behavior. Conclusions discuss alternative models of rationality and heuristics and how the presented findings may be used for constructing novel theories on crime and social norms. Policy implications are also discussed.

AB We propose that the emergent phenomenon know as "desakota," the rapid urbanization of densely populated rural populations in the newly developed world, particularly China, can be simulated using agent-based models that combine bottom-up actions with global interactions. We argue that desakota represents a surprising and unusual form of urbanization well-matched to processes of land development that are locally determined but moderated by the higher-level macroeconomy. We develop a simple logic that links local household reform to global urban reform, translating these ideas into a model structure that reflects these two scales. Our model first determines the rate of growth of different spatial aggregates using linear statistical analysis. It then allocates this growth to the local level using "developer agents" who determine the transformation or mutation of rural households to urban pursuits based on local land costs, accessibilities, and growth management practices. The model is applied to desakota development in the Suzhou region for the period 1990 to 2000. We show how the global rates of change predicted at the township level in the Wuxian City region surrounding Suzhou are tempered by local transformations of rural to urban land uses which we predict using cellular automata rules. The model is implemented in the RePast 3 software and is validated using a blend of data taken from remote sensing and government statistical sources. It represents an example of generative social science that fuses plausible behavior with formalized logics matched against empirical evidence, essential in showing how novel patterns of urbanization such as desakota emerge.

ID DYNAMICS
AB This work extends a popular agent-based simulation model of civil violence and analyses the effects of these extensions within the test-case region of Iran. First, a macro-level model of civil violence using geographic information science methods and real-world transportation network data is modelled and introduced. A detailed experimental design analyses the sensitivity of the modelled outbreak of civil violence on road network structures. Next, we use individual agent location to develop a personal legitimacy value for each agent of the system and model this legitimacy as a function of agent movement through the region. The resulting models indicate that the occurrence of civil violence in the derived simulations is very sensitive to network composition and connectivity of a given sub-region and identify a small number of behavioural outbreak trends to which sub-regions can be classified. We also show that regional legitimacy can have a marked effect on central authority agent distribution and movement.

AB It has been found that the radiolysis of the aqueous solutions of alpha,beta-amino alcohols leads to the formation of degradation products of the parent substances. The experimental data suggest that the degradation process includes the stage of the formation of aminyl radicals, which undergo decomposition with the simultaneous cleavage of -C-C- and -O-H bonds through a five-membered transition state. The radiation-induced degradation of amino alcohols is enhanced in an alkaline medium, in which the amino group is deprotonated, and is blocked via the etherification of the hydroxyl group in the parent substances or the introduction of reducing agents.

TI Critical transition for colliding swarms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
LA English
DT Article
ID SPATIAL-PATTERNS; FLOCKING; STABILITY; BEHAVIOR
AB Swarming patterns that emerge from the interaction of many mobile agents are a subject of great interest in fields ranging from biology to physics and robotics. In some application areas, multiple swarms effectively interact and collide, producing complex spatiotemporal patterns. Recent studies have begun to address swarm-on-swarm dynamics, and in particular the scattering of two large, colliding swarms with nonlinear interactions. To build on early numerical insights, we develop a self-propelled, rigid-body approximation that can be used to predict the parameters under which colliding swarms are expected to form a milling state. Our analytical method relies on the assumption that, upon collision, two swarms oscillate near a limit cycle, where each swarm rotates around the other while maintaining an approximately constant and uniform density. Using this approach we are able to predict the critical swarm-on-swarm interaction coupling, below which two colliding swarms merely scatter, as a function of physical swarm parameters. We show that the critical coupling gives a lower bound for all impact parameters, including head-on collision, and corresponds to a saddle-node bifurcation of a stable limit cycle in the uniform, constant density approximation. Our results are tested and found to agree with both small and large multiagent simulations.

TI Homophily dynamics outweigh network topology in an extended Axelrod's
   Cultural Dissemination Model
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article

ID SMALL-WORLD
AB Personal social networks reveal potential sources of dyadic social influence. Social influence is picked up as a main principle of Axelrod's model of cultural dissemination. Even though social influence is performed via social networks, the model is generally just run on a regular lattice instead of more complex network topologies. In this paper, we analyse a concurrent extension to Axelrod's model for opinion-based groups, and explore the performance of changing the network topology.
   Our objective is to seed the Axelrod model with attitudinal survey data as an empirical data application. In the model, the culture is a set of features which in turn is defined by a set of traits. Respectively, in survey data, the attitudes are captured by items with a fixed set of response options. The direct correspondence of the structure of survey data to the model makes it an ideal candidate. Here, we simulate and analyse the extended Axelrod model to explore its dynamics and outcomes, with the standard Axelrod model results serving as a benchmark. As well as the lattice, which the Axelrod model is usually simulated on, we test other network topologies. The conducted simulations explore the parameter space for the uniformly distributed models, and draw parallels between the results, when applying it to an empirical, attitudinal data set.
   After assessing the level of impact of the network structures, we conclude that there is almost no influence of the underlying network structure on the macro level outcomes. The reason seems to be that the homophily structure among the individuals outweighs the impact of the network topology in the long run simulations. Under the premise, that the number of features is higher than the number of traits and that the system size is limited, the extended Axelrod model can be used to simulate attitudes from a survey without specifying the underlying network.

TI Modeling Warfare in Social Animals: A "Chemical" Approach
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID LANCHESTER MODELS
AB We present here a general method for modelling the dynamics of battles among social animals. The proposed method exploits the procedures widely used to model chemical reactions, but still uncommon in behavioural studies. We applied this methodology to the interpretation of experimental observations of battles between two species of ants (Lasius neglectus and Lasius paralienus), but this scheme may have a wider applicability and can be extended to other species as well. We performed two types of experiment labelled as interaction and mortality. The interaction experiments are designed to obtain information on the combat dynamics and lasted one hour. The mortality ones provide information on the casualty rates of the two species and lasted five hours. We modelled the interactions among ants using a chemical model which considers the single ant individuals and fighting groups analogously to atoms and molecules. The mean-field behaviour of the model is described by a set of non-linear differential equations. We also performed stochastic simulations of the corresponding agent-based model by means of the Gillespie event-driven integration scheme. By fitting the stochastic trajectories with the deterministic model, we obtained the probability distribution of the reaction parameters. The main result that we obtained is a dominance phase diagram, that gives the average trajectory of a generic battle, for an arbitrary number of opponents. This phase diagram was validated with some extra experiments. With respect to other war models (e. g., Lanchester's ones), our chemical model considers all phases of the battle and not only casualties. This allows a more detailed description of the battle (with a larger number of parameters), allowing the development of more sophisticated models (e. g., spatial ones), with the goal of distinguishing collective effects from the strategic ones.

As an important modeling constraint, we assume that each mobile agent has a limited sensing or communication radius. Based on the geometry of Voronoi partitions and proximity graphs, we analyze a class of aggregate objective functions and propose coverage algorithms in continuous and discrete time. These algorithms have convergence guarantees and are spatially distributed with respect to appropriate proximity graphs. Numerical simulations illustrate the results.

AB Background Public awareness is crucial for successful deployment of tidal energy, a renewable energy source that can provide clean electricity to remote islands. However, considering public attitudes on tidal energy are not well known, especially in developing countries, a barrier exists in implementing public engagement strategies. This study aims to contribute by identifying strategies for information provision-the initial step in public engagement-and estimate how these can be engaged to enhance support for tidal energy among the local public in a remote area of a developing country, in this case, Flores Timur Regency, Indonesia, considering their socio-cultural background. Methods In this paper, we employ statistical analyses using multinomial probit modelling to identify the key variables that shape information flow. The aptness of the variables is then verified using post-estimation techniques for their use as input parameters for the simulation of the information flow in the field study area. Agent-based simulation (ABS) is employed to replicate the actual conditions in Flores Timur Regency, Indonesia, and simulate the flow of information through the local community. Results According to the multinomial probit estimations, the people belonging to the top hierarchical group show a higher probability to support tidal energy compared to the members belonging to the lower groups. Understandably, around twice as many information flow cycles are needed to disseminate information to the members of the lowest hierarchical group, compared to the members of the top hierarchical group. The results also show that increasing the amount of available information has a positive impact on information dissemination. Conclusions This study demonstrated that information provision is highly effective with propagation of information that specifically highlights the individual benefits, rather than the community benefits of tidal energy. Additionally, savings in terms of costs, time, and efforts can be realized if the most influential members of the local community are targeted initially before including all other stakeholders. The study also indicated that locals absorb more information and increase their support for tidal energy when additional data is made available. Finally, as long-term strategy, information provision becomes most effective when the local population gains higher educational capabilities.

AB The excited states of mustard and related alkyl sulfides have been calculated using time-dependent density functional theory. Among the seven commonly used density functionals, PBE0 exhibits the most accurate excited energy, while the Pearson-related coefficient of calculated energies and experimental peaks reaches 0.98. Boltzmann average analysis reveals that excited energies of different conformers are almost the same. The calculated excited states of mustard come to 5.56 and 6.00 eV, which are assigned as n -> sigma* transition by the natural transition orbital visualization. Besides, sulfur ethers with C(2 nu)symmetry show similar ultraviolet properties as mustard, whereas the excited states of simulated agents with the SCH2CH2Cl group differ from mustard.

AB Purpose: To determine the compartmentalization of the blood pool agent gadofosveset and the effect of its transient binding to albumin on the quantification of steady-state fractional myocardial blood volume (fMBV).
   Methods: Myocardial vascular fraction measurements were simulated assuming the limiting cases (slow or fast) of two-compartment water exchange for different contrast agent injection concentrations, binding fractions, bound and free relaxivities, and true cardiac vascular fractions. fMBV was measured in five healthy volunteers (4 males, 1 female, average age 33) at 1.5 T after administration of five injections of gadofosveset. The measurements in the volunteers were retrospectively compared to measurements of fMBV after three serial injections of the ultra-small, paramagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) blood pool agent ferumoxytol in an experimental animal. The true fMBV and exchange rate of water protons in both human and animal data sets was determined by chi square minimization.
   Results: Simulations showed an error in the measurement of fMBV due to partial binding of gadofosveset of less than 30%. Measured fMBV values over-estimate simulation predictions, and approach cardiac extracellular volume (22%), which suggests that the intravascular assumption may not be appropriate for the myocardium, although it may apply to more distal perfusion beds. In comparison, fMBV measured with ferumoxytol (5%, with slow water proton exchange across vascular wall) agree with published values of myocardial vascular fraction. Further comparison between myocardium relaxation rates induced by gadofosveset and by other extracellular and intravascular contrast agents showed that gadofosveset behaves like an extracellular contrast agent.
   Conclusions: The distribution of the volunteer data indicates that a three-compartment model, with slow water exchange of gadofosveset and water protons between the vascular and interstitial compartments, and fast water exchange between the interstitium and the myocytes, is appropriate. The ferumoxytol measurements indicate that this USPIO is an intravascular contrast agent that can be used to quantify myocardial blood volume, with the appropriate correction for water exchange using a two-compartment water exchange model.

AB Increasing building energy efficiency is one the most cost-effective ways to reduce emissions. The use of thermal insulation materials mitigates heat loss in buildings, therefore minimising heat energy needs. In recent years, several papers were published on the subject of foam alkali-activated cements with enhanced thermal conductivity. However, on those papers cost analysis was strangely avoided. This paper presents experimental results on one-part alkali-activated cements. It also includes global warming potential assessment and cost analysis. Foam one-part alkali-activated cements cost simulations considering two carbon dioxide social costs scenarios are also included. The results show that one-part alkali-activated cements mixtures based on 26% OPC + 58.3% FA + 8% CS + 7.7% CH and 3.5% hydrogen peroxide constitute a promising cost-efficient (67 euro/m(3)), thermal insulation solution for floor heating systems. This mixture presents a low global warming potential of 443 KgCO(2eq)/m(3). The results confirm that in both carbon dioxide social cost scenarios the mixture 26 OPC + 58.3 FA + 8 CS + 7.7 CH with 3.5% hydrogen peroxide foaming agent is still the most cost efficient.

AB In this review the authors summarize the experimental data on the role of a selected group of metalloproteins, particularly viral (v) and cellular (c) zinc finger proteins (ZFP) and iron containing proteins which are involved in cell proliferation, neovascularization, apoptosis, and viral infection. Furthermore, this review summarizes the data embracing the hypothesis that disruption of certain metalloproteins by novel pharmacological agents is a key factor in controlling viral and proliferative diseases. The primary goal of this review is to show the potential therapeutic applications of ZFP disrupting agents, zinc chelators and iron chelators in the control of viral diseases and cancer. It is known that zinc or iron deficiency, resulting from exposure of culture cells to membrane-permeable Zn2+ or Fe2+-chelators, can induced apoptosis in virally transformed Fe cells while normal cells remain unaffected under these conditions. Apoptosis is possibly due to simultaneous inactivation of vZFP, cZFP, and/or iron containing proteins, which are essential for maintenance of cellular and viral structure and which are activated in virally transformed cells. New insights concerning apoptosis, viral metalloproteins, and novel antiviral agents will also be reviewed. From the evidence reviewed one can infer that development of a variety of drugs that control or neutralize vZFP may lean to a new therapeutic approach directed at controlling and preventing a wide spectrum of viral diseases and cancer. Furthermore, the results suggest that these agents may be useful to prevent transmission of viral diseases. Finally, this review not only points out the limits of our understanding of this system, but also directs scientists to opportunities for future research.

Two event-triggered control strategies, one centralized and the other distributed, are developed, which can reduce the frequency of control updating. Under the proposed protocols, the multiple nonholonomic systems can achieve consensus, and the bound of inter-event time intervals is provided to illustrate that no Zeno behavior exists. Finally, numerical simulations are also provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategies.

AB Individuals, initially living in a Mirrleesian economy A, have outside options consisting in settling down in a laissez-faire country B while paying positive migration costs. We first examine the effect of the threat of migration, assuming participation constraints are taken into account for all individuals, and show that optimal linear income taxes are obtained as corner solutions. We then consider a social criterion allowing emigration of the highest-skilled individuals and show by means of an example that social welfare may rise following an increase in income redistribution, despite this resulting in the departure of the most productive individuals. Numerical simulations on French data illustrate the lack of degrees of freedom offered by linear taxation when agents can vote with their feet, which may be regarded as an argument against linear taxes.

ID SZNAJD MODEL; INNOVATION; EVOLUTION
AB We introduce an agent-based model for the spreading of technological developments in socio-economic systems where the technology is mainly used for the collaboration/interaction of agents. Agents use products of different technologies to collaborate with each other which induce costs proportional to the difference of technological levels. Additional costs arise when technologies of different providers are used. Agents can adopt technologies and providers of their interacting partners in order to reduce their costs leading to microscopic rearrangements of the system. Analytical calculations and computer simulations revealed that starting from a random configuration of different technological levels a complex time evolution emerges where the spreading of advanced technologies and the overall technological progress of the system are determined by the amount of advantages more advanced technologies provide, and by the structure of the social environment of agents. We show that agents tend to form clusters of identical technological level with a power law size distribution. When technological progress arises, the spreading of technologies in the system can be described by extreme order statistics. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Computer simulation has recently been recognised by criminologists as a useful tool for bridging the gap between theoretical and empirical analyses of organised crime and for supplementing their weaknesses. GLODERS-S is an innovative and configurable agent-based simulator specialised in reproducing the dynamics of a specific type of criminal organisations: protection racketeering groups. The simulator adopts an event-based approach that provides a more realistic operation of the agents, which integrated with its configurability provides policy-makers with a highly flexible platform for analysing multiple scenarios and assessing policies to counter organised crime. In this paper, we describe the principles of the simulator design, its features and limitations, and possible applications.

AB Electronic descriptors obtained from AM1 molecular orbital calculations were employed, along with the empirical parameters log P and pi, in a multivariate statistical analysis of the quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) in a group of sixteen 2-(substituted phenyl)indan-1,3-diones possessing hypolipidemic activities. AM1 descriptors were obtained both for the isolated molecule model and, to simulate the solvent effect, for the COSMO model (conductor-like screening model) in our QSAR analysis. From sixteen studied derivatives, three were excluded from the set of molecules used in the model building stage in order to serve as a test set. In general, the results obtained from this test set validated our quantitative models, which were based on linear regressions and principal component analysis (PCA). From these results, new derivatives were predicted to be more potent hypolipidemic agents than the indan-1,3-diones for which experimental activities were determined. For instance, our results suggest that 2-(ortho-hydroxy-phenyl)indan-1,3-dione is a potential candidate for new experimental screening studies for reducing serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels.

AB An Ontology-based Fuzzy Event Extraction (OFEE) agent for Chinese e-news summarization is proposed in this article. The OFEE agent contains Retrieval Agent (RA), Document Processing Agent (DPA) and Fuzzy Inference Agent (FIA) to perform the event extraction for Chinese e-news summarization. First, RA automatically retrieves Internet e-news periodically, stores them into the e-news repository, and sends them to DPA for document processing. Then, the DPA will utilize the Chinese Part-of-speech (POS) tagger provided by Chinese knowledge information processing group to process the retrieved e-news and filter the Chinese term set by Chinese term filter. Next, the FIA and Event Ontology Filter (EOF) extract the e-news event ontology based on the Chinese term set and domain ontology. Finally, the Summarization Agent (SA) will summarize the e-news by the extracted-event ontology. By the simulation, the proposed method can summarize the Chinese weather e-news effectively.

AB Reducing CO2 emission in ironmaking process is pressing issue. Low RAR (reducing agent rate) operation of the blast furnace and the utilization of hydrogenous reducing agent are effective to reduce CO2 emission. In this study, the influence of the hydrogenous reducing agent on the combustibility of the pulverized coal was examined by using a small scale combustion furnace. As a result, the combustibility of the pulverized coal was improved by simultaneous injection of the pulverized coal and the hydrogenous reducing agent. Furthermore, the fundamental study about the effect of natural gas (CH4) injection point on the combustibility of the pulverized coal was conducted by experiment using above mentioned small scale combustion furnace and by three-dimensional numerical analysis for further high efficiency. In the case of the relative position of CH, injection point and the pulverized coal injection point being near, the ignition point of the pulverized coal came closer to lance tip. Especially, in the case of CH4 injection point being upstream in blow pipe about 0 to 20 mm from the pulverized coal injection point, the fastest ignition of the pulverized coal was confirmed by experimental and calculation results.

AB Bottom trawling activities resuspend large amounts of sediment and may be the main agent of sediment transportation in some areas. During periods of intensive fishing by large trawler fleets the high-turbidity environmental conditions they create may become semi-permanent. Little is known about the potential effects of this resuspended sediment on the survival and physiology of marine fish. We carried out a worst-case-scenario simulation whereby groups of cod Gadus morhua were exposed to the highest reported mud concentration behind trawls (550 mg l(-1)) for periods of 24 h, 5 d and 10 d. No mortality was observed in any of the experimental groups. Histological analyses of gill lamellae of fish exposed to mud suspension for 24 h showed acute pathological changes in the form of multifocal degenerative lesions. After 5 d exposure, adaptive changes to cope with the turbid environment were observed. These comprised hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the gill epithelium and became more marked and widespread after 10 d exposure. The gill lesions observed were similar to those reported in other species exposed to a turbid environment and were in those cases reversible. Analyses of blood plasma cortisol levels showed higher values for fish in the 5 d exposure group than for fish in the 1 d exposure group. No other between-group differences were significant. The within-group variation was high in all groups but especially in the 10 d exposure group.

AB The current role of chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer is limited. Chemotherapy usually consists of 5-fluorouracil (5FU) and gemcitabine either as a single agent or in combinations. However, response rates are below 15% with minor effects on overall survival. Due to the aggressive behavior of the disease, current emphasis of new experimental chemotherapy is also focusing on clinical benefit: improvement of pain, performance status or weight. The results with gemcitabine indicated that evaluation of new chemotherapeutic agents in pancreatic cancer should not be limited to the evaluation of response rates; single agent gemcitabine not only showed higher response rates than 5FU, but also resulted in clinical benefit for the patients. Several new agents have been introduced into the clinic for treatment of various,oastro-intestinal malignancies, whereas novel agents with different types of targets, such as marimastat deserve further attention. Several oral formulations of 5FU, such as capecitabine, UFT, and eniluracil with 5FU, aim to simulate long-term continuous infusion. Response rates of these formulations are comparable to those of 5FU continuous infusion and 5FU bolus injections. However, the convenience of oral administration with reliable plasma drug concentrations makes these agents very attractive as a replacement of traditional 5FU administration. Since 5FU acts by inhibition of thymidylate synthase (TS), resulting in inhibition of DNA synthesis, several new antifolates, directed towards TS, have been developed. However, these agents, such as ZD1694 (Tomudex, Raltitrexed) and LY231514 (MTA, multitargetted antifolate) showed only limited efficacy. Other new agents active in colorectal cancer, e.g. the topoisomerase I inhibitors topotecan and CPT-11, showed only minor activity. The same was observed for the taxanes. Combinations of gemcitabine (cisplatin, 5FU, epirubicin, marimastat) show promising activities, not only regarding response but also with respect to clinical benefit. The effects were better than that for each agent separately. Thus, despite limited activity of single agents, novel combinations especially with gemcitabine are promising, with emphasis on improvement of the clinical benefit of patients.

AB Social networks provide an established tool to implement heterogeneous contact structures in epidemiological models. Dynamic temporal changes in contact structure and ranging behaviour of wildlife may impact disease dynamics. A consensus has yet to emerge, however, concerning the conditions in which network dynamics impact model outcomes, as compared to static approximations that average contact rates over longer time periods. Furthermore, as many pathogens can be transmitted both environmentally and via close contact, it is important to investigate the relative influence of both transmission routes in real-world populations. Here, we use empirically derived networks from a population of wild primates, Verreaux's sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi), and simulated networks to investigate pathogen spread in dynamic vs. static social networks. First, we constructed a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model of Cryptosporidium spread in wild Verreaux's sifakas. We incorporated social and environmental transmission routes and parameterized the model for two different climatic seasons. Second, we used simulated networks and greater variation in epidemiological parameters to investigate the conditions in which dynamic networks produce larger outbreak sizes than static networks. We found that average outbreak size of Cryptosporidium infections in sifakas was larger when the disease was introduced in the dry season than in the wet season, driven by an increase in home range overlap towards the end of the dry season. Regardless of season, dynamic networks always produced larger average outbreak sizes than static networks. Larger outbreaks in dynamic models based on simulated networks occurred especially when the probability of transmission and recovery were low. Variation in tie strength in the dynamic networks also had a major impact on outbreak size, while network modularity had a weaker influence than epidemiological parameters that determine transmission and recovery. Our study adds to emerging evidence that dynamic networks can change predictions of disease dynamics, especially if the disease shows low transmissibility and a long infectious period, and when environmental conditions lead to enhanced between-group contact after an infectious agent has been introduced.

AB Choice mechanisms and social networks, including "marriage markets", seem well-suited to be modelled using agent-type simulations. Few real-world empirical examples are available in the public literature, particularly those using human populations of size. We reviewed partnership models in both the micro-simulation and agent-based literatures. We then empirically implemented an algorithm derived from two established models using inter-censal data on first partnerships in New Zealand over the period 1981-2006. The purpose of the exercise was to test the robustness of different parameter settings and to determine whether a model simulating partnership selection among eligible never-married young adults at one census period is feasible for predicting patterns of partnership, co-habitation and marriage at the next. Varying simulation time and social network size parameters of the model showed that patterns of ethnic partnering could be consistently produced and were not dependent on these model settings. Examining the different scoring methods showed that age similarity, education similarity, and previous partnering patterns could produce partnership patterns similar to those seen in the census. The simulation produced patterns of ethnic partnering similar to those seen in the census and seemed robust to different parameter settings. To further improve these results, an optimised combination of the scoring components is proposed. The simulations also provided preliminary evidence of ethnic preferences in the New Zealand marriage market.

AB We introduce a growing network evolution model with nodal attributes. The model describes the interactions between potentially violent V and non-violent N agents who have different affinities in establishing connections within their own population versus between the populations. The model is able to generate all stable triads observed in real social systems. In the framework of rate equations theory, we employ the mean-field approximation to derive analytical expressions of the degree distribution and the local clustering coefficient for each type of nodes. Analytical derivations agree well with numerical simulation results. The assortativity of the potentially violent network qualitatively resembles the connectivity pattern in terrorist networks that was recently reported. The assortativity of the network driven by aggression shows clearly different behavior than the assortativity of the networks with connections of non-aggressive nature in agreement with recent empirical results of an online social system.

AB Mechanisms promoting the evolution of cooperation in two players and two strategies (2 x 2) evolutionary games have been investigated in great detail over the past decades. Understanding the effects of repeated interactions in multiplayer spatial games, however, is a formidable challenge. In this paper, we present a multiplayer evolutionary game model in which agents play iterative games in spatial populations. N-player versions of the well-known Prisoner's Dilemma and the Snowdrift games are used as the basis of the investigation. These games were chosen as they have emerged as the most promising mathematical metaphors for studying cooperative phenomena. Here, we have adopted an experimental approach to study the emergent behavior, exploring different parameter configurations via numerical simulations. Key model parameters include the cost-to-benefit ratio, the size of groups, the number of repeated encounters, and the interaction topology. Our simulation results reveal that, while the introduction of iterated interactions does promote higher levels of cooperative behavior across a wide range of parameter settings, the cost-to-benefit ratio and group size are important factors in determining the appropriate length of beneficial repeated interactions. In particular, increasing the number of iterated interactions may have a detrimental effect when the cost-to-benefit ratio and group size are small.

AB It has been discovered more than a decade ago that autistic people cannot properly understand and reproduce mental states and emotions. We hypothesize that people with autism suffer from difficulties in learning social rules from examples. Many remediation strategies have not taken this into account. Therefore an appropriate remediation strategy is to teach not simply via examples but to teach the rule along with it. In this study we suggest a reasoning rehabilitation strategy, based on playing with a computer based mental simulator that is capable of modeling mental and emotional states of the real world. A model of the mental world is presented in 12 steps. We describe our implementation of a natural language multiagent system that simulates this model. In addition we describe the system's user interface for autistic rehabilitation. This system is subject to short-term and long-term evaluation of rehabilitation of autistic reasoning. Case studies with children who used it extensively are presented. Implications specifically in terms of autistic rehabilitation as well as generally in terms of reasoning about mental states are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The q-voter model, a variant of the classic voter model, has been analyzed by several authors. While allowing us to study opinion dynamics, this model is also believed to be one of the most representative among the many defined in the wide field of sociophysics. Here, we investigate the consequences of conformity on the consensus reaching process, by numerically simulating a q-voter model with agents behaving either as conformists or nonconformists, embedded on heterogeneous network topologies (as small-world and scale-free). In fact, although it is already known that conformity enhances the reaching of consensus, the related process is often studied only on fully-connected networks, thus strongly limiting our full understanding of it. This paper represents a first step in the direction of analyzing more realistic social models, showing that different opinion formation phases, driven by the conformist agents density, are observable. As a result, we identify threshold values of the density of conformist agents, varying across different topologies and separating different regimes of our system, ranging from a disordered phase, where different opinions coexist, to a gradually more ordered phase, where consensus is eventually reached.

AB Azolylalkylquinolines (AAQs) are a family of quinolines with varying degrees of cytotoxic activity (comparable or moderately superior to adriamycin in some cases) developed in the past decade in our group where their exact mode of action is still unclear. In this study the most probable DNA binding mode of AAQs was investigated employing a novel flexible ligand docking approach by using AutoDock 3.0. Forty-nine AAQs with known experimental inhibitory activity were docked onto d(CGCAAATTTGCG)(2), d(CGATCG)(2) and d(CGCG)(2) oligonucleotides retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (PDB IDs: 102D, 1D12 and 1D32, respectively) as the representatives of the three plausible models of interactions between chemotherapeutic agents and DNA (groove binding, groove binding plus intercalation and bisinterealation, respectively). Good correlation (r(2) = 0.64) between calculated binding energies and experimental inhibitory activities was obtained using groove binding plus intercalation model for phenyl-azolylalkylquinoline (PAAQ) series. Our findings show that the most probable mode of action of PAAQs as DNA binding agents is via intercalation of quinolinic moiety between CG base pairs with linker chain and azole moiety binding to the minor groove.

AB Background: Adequate muscle relaxation is important for ensuring optimal conditions for intubation. Although acceleromyography of the adductor pollicis muscle is commonly used to assess conditions for intubation, we hypothesized that acceleromyography of the trapezius is more indicative of optimal intubating conditions. The primary outcome was the difference between both measurement sites with regard to prediction of good or acceptable intubating conditions.
   Methods: Neuromuscular blockade after injection of rocuronium 0.3 mg/kg IV was measured simultaneously with acceleromyography of the adductor pollicis muscle and the trapezius muscle in sixty female patients, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I to III, undergoing general anesthesia for gynecologic surgery. Exclusion criteria were: expected difficult tracheal intubation (e.g. history of difficult intubation, reduced mouth opening (< 2 cm) and/or Mallampati Score 4), increased risk of pulmonary aspiration (e.g. gastroesophageal reflux or delayed gastric emptying) allergies to drugs used during the study, pregnancy, neuromuscular diseases, medication with potential to influence neuromuscular function (e.g. furosemide, magnesium, cephalosporins) and hepatic or renal insufficiency (serum bilirubin > 26 mu mol/L, serum creatinine > 90 mu mol/l). Patients were randomized to 2 groups: group A (n = 30): endotracheal intubation after onset of the neuromuscular block at the adductor pollicis muscle. Group B (n = 30): endotracheal intubation after onset at the trapezius muscle. Intubating conditions were compared between both groups by means of a standardised score (the Copenhagen score) with Fisher's exact test.
   Results: Onset of the block after rocuronium injection was observed at the adductor pollicis muscle compared to the trapezius with 2.8 (1.1) versus 2.5 (1.1) min (mean +/- SD; P = 0.006). Intubating conditions were poor in 2 patients (7%) of group A, and in 1 patient (3%) of group T. They were acceptable (either excellent or good) in 28 patients (93%) in group A, and in 1 patient (97%) in group T (P = 0.82).
   Conclusions: Performing acceleromyography at the trapezius muscle reduced the time between injection of neuromuscular blocking agents and intubation by 18 s (11%). Thus, trapezius muscle acceleromyography is an acceptable alternative to adductor pollicis muscle acceleromyography in predicting acceptable intubating conditions, which allows for earlier indication of adequate intubating conditions.

AB The aim of this study was to determine the effects of a diet supplemented with rumen-protected linoleic acids (C18:2) on the composition of milk fat and the energy balance of dairy cattle during the first 15 wk of lactation. The 32 Holstein-Friesian cows were allotted in two treatment groups; in the experimental group one-third of the starch (relative to the control group) was substituted with protected fat on an energy basis. Milk samples from all cows were collected weekly from week 2 to 15 postpartum (p.p.). To analyze the milk fat composition milk samples from 16 cows in each group were collected from week 6 and 7 as well as from week 13 and 14 p.p. and were mixed together, respectively. Triglyceride analysis demonstrated an extensive use of depot fat in both cow groups at the beginning of the lactation period. However, calculated energy balance, triglyceride composition and back fat thickness showed that the usual deficit of energy intake in early lactation was significantly shortened in the experimental group by three weeks. In comparison with the control group the content of the saturated fatty acids (FAs) C12, C14 and C16 in the experimental group decreased by 17.3% at 6 to 7 wk and by 19.2% at 13 to 14 wk. The stearic acid content of milk fat was increased by 25.9% at 6 to 7 wk and by 27.7% at 13 to 14 wk in the experimental group. The content of cis Delta9 oleic acid was increased by 21.6% at 6 to 7 and by 30.3% at 13 to 14 wk, while the C18:2 FA content was doubled as compared with the control group. Thus besides the increase of the trans-C-18:1 FA (TFA) content the nutritional value of fats could be improved using the experimental fat supplement. The TFA content still remained within the range of variation of natural milk fats. Additionally the experimental fat intake led to a number of desired effects; an increase in the content of conjugated linoleic acids (cis Delta9,trans Delta11) by 55.9% (6 to 7 wk) and by 97.1% (13 to 14 wk p.p.), respectively, and a decrease in the cholesterol level. Further, the butyric acid content increased relatively by more than 20%. The addition of this fat resulted simultaneously in a changed triglyceride composition with increased C50, C52 and C54 contents. Thus a markedly improved spreadability of the resulting butter might be expected.

AB Purpose. The regular distribution in space and the stability in time of the hydrophilic sphere surrounding iobitridol were investigated. This is a novel yet important concept in the design of polyiodinated contrast agents since such a sphere is meant to hide their hydrophobic core and thus prevent hydrophobic interactions with biomacromolecules and hence chemotoxicity.
   Methods. The methods used were experimental (HPLC, H-1- and C-13-NMR spectroscopy) and computational (calculation of conformational behavior and molecular electrostatic potentials).
   Results. Iobitridol exists as a mixture of stereoisomers due to hindered rotation around several bonds. High-temperature molecular dynamics established the existence between 0 and 15 kcal/mol of 238 conformers belonging to 14 classes. Most of these conformers have an inaccessible hydrophobic core, and variable temperature molecular dynamics confirmed that the hydrophilic sphere around iobitridol is stable against external disruption.
   Conclusions. This study has demonstrated that iobitridol fulfills the physicochemical and structural criteria believed to render a polyiodinated contrast agent inert toward interacting with biomacromolecules.

AB Existing models of agricultural decisionmaking based on economic optimization often fall short of capturing the complex dynamics of land-use choices at both individual parcel and watershed-level scales. The complexity arises from an interplay of several factors, as explained by Herbert Simon's model of bounded rationality, the theory of diffusion of innovations through spatial contagion, the role of personal environmental values and local culture, and simple historical momentum. This complexity can be captured using 'artificial life agents' that model land-use choice for individual parcels by considering characteristics and personal beliefs of the owner or operator, physical traits of the land, and information obtained via social networks. Agents are therefore able to consider holistically a large number of factors affecting land-use choice. The creation of agent-based models of human behavior described herein is based upon empirical data on the acceptance of Conservation Reserve Program for the Cache River watershed of southern Illinois (USA). These models are interfaced with a geographic information system to produce a spatial decision support system capable of anticipating the effects of policies that affect land-use decisionmaking on a real landscape and their economic performance.

AB Adenocarcinomas of the nose are regarded as an occupational disease in Germany and other European countries, and workers exposed to oak or beech wood-dust in the course of their work receive compensation if they incur adenocarcinoma of the nose. This has prompted a joint research project to record the functional and morphological changes of the nasal mucosa and/or paranasal sinus of 149 exposed subjects and 33 controls in accordance with a defined occupational exposure. To ensure the quantitative and qualitative reliability of the exposure data, 1,349 measurements at the company workplace were taken and analyses of 614 wood samples performed; parallel to this, the genotoxic effects of the most important substances used in the wood-working industry were tested. Apart from this, latency periods and morbidity rates in Germany were investigated. Partial findings of this research projects have been evaluated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). According to these evaluations and the findings presented here, the following points can be made: i) Morphological changes in the nasal mucosa after exposure to wood-dust resulted in an increase in cylindrocellular hyperplasias and, in functional terms, a tendency towards improved nasal clearance was observed. Chromium and Formaldehyde, on the other hand, tended to give rise to an increase in the number of squamous metaplasias. This might explain the preference for the histological types of adenocarcinoma among subjects exposed to wood-dust. ii) In tissue samples more dysplasias were found among those exposed to oak and beech wood-dust. Subjects exposed to wood preserving agents had dysplasias only if they were simultaneously exposed to oak and beech wood-dust. The latter effect did not quite reach the level of significance (p = 0.07) on account of the low numbers of cases, iii) The investigation of genotoxic effects showed that oak and beech contain genotoxic substances that can be dissolved by means of ethanol and cyclohexane; they also showed that 3 out of 8 wood preservatives, 5 out of 16 stains, and 2 out of 11 paints from the wood-working industry are genotoxic too. Apart from this, lindane and PCP have proved to be genotoxic in the nasal cells of rats and human beings. Analysis of 614 wood samples from wood-preserving agents showed that almost 73% contained agents of this type, even in woods described by the companies as being guaranteed free of wood preservatives. iv) According to an analysis of 147 cases accepted since 1985 as a pensionable occupational illness by the Holz-Berufsgenossenschaft (an industrial compensation society for employees in the wood-working industry), the disease was much more apparent in small companies where there is multi-factorial exposure, than in large companies where the exposure factor tends to have a single component. This points to the combined effects of hardwood dusts and chemicals as being the cause, v) According to published findings, the incidence of the disease in England seems to be on the decline. In Germany, increasing latency; periods also point to a decline in the number of cases, although both countries have only very recently introduced effective prevention measures against exposure to wood-dust. This also leads to the assumption that wood-dusts cannot be the only cause of this type of cancer. vi) These findings tally with the evaluation by the IARC confirming the special part that hardwood dusts play in the development of nasal cancer. The findings presented here also indicate combined effects as being the cause of this type of cancer.
   This hypothesis cannot be confirmed until the conclusion of long-term animal experiments, currently being conducted, to test how the effects of chemicals such as lindane, PCP, and chromate compare with use of oak wood-dust.

AB Carbon black has diverse industrial applications such as a reinforcing agent in tires and as a black pigment in printing inks. Flame aerosol synthesis is the commonly employed route for large scale production of carbon black. A coupled flame dynamics - monodisperse population balance model for the synthesis of carbon black in an aerosol flame reactor is presented here. The population balance model was incorporated into the commercial computational fluid dynamics software CFX to simulate the effect of flame dynamics on particle synthesis. The model was tested with published experimental data for acetylene black synthesis through oxidative thermal decomposition of acetylene with oxygen in a premixed flame reactor. The predicted axial temperature profiles at different equivalence ratios (actual acetylene/oxidizer ratio divided by stoichiometric acetylene/oxidizer ratio) were reasonably close to experimental data. The effect of the equivalence ratio on process parameters like maximum temperature of the flame, specific surface area of particles and flame structure was investigated. It was observed that the maximum temperature of the flame and specific surface area of carbon black particles decrease upon increasing the equivalence ratio which is in agreement with published experimental studies. Simulation results are also presented for carbon black synthesis in a diffusion flame reactor with different burner designs. (C) 2010 The Society of Powder Technology Japan.

AB Purpose: To determine the effect of dentin desensitizing agents (oxalates and glutaraldehyde) and dentin bonding agents, with and without resin-based composite (RBC) on dentin permeability and morphology of the dentin surface. The influence of saliva and toothbrushing on these agents was also evaluated. Materials and Methods: Radicular dentin discs +/-1 mm thick were obtained from extracted human teeth. The thickness of the discs was standardized by grinding them with 600 grit silicon carbide powder. Both pulpal and periodontal surfaces of the discs were treated with 6% citric acid for 2 min prior to the baseline measurement of dentin permeability. Permeability was measured for the discs, using a split-chamber apparatus, at four different time points: at baseline, after treatment with each desensitizing modality, after 24 hrs of saliva immersion and after simulated toothbrushing equivalent to 3 weeks of normal brushing. The treatment modalities were: Sensodyne Dentin Desensitizer, Gluma Dentin Desensitizer, All-Bond DS (primers without etching), Etch+Primers (All-Bond 2 system), Etch+Primers+Adhesive and Etch+Primers+ Adhesive+RBC (Elite Flo). Radicular dentin discs were prepared separately for scanning electron microscopy (SEM). One group was left untreated as the control group. Discs in the other groups were treated with the modalities listed above. One disc from each group was viewed under the SEM after treatment with the desensitizing modality. The second disc in each group was viewed after 24 hrs of saliva immersion following desensitizing treatment and the third disc after 3 weeks of simulated toothbrushing following desensitizing treatment and saliva immersion. Results: The greatest reduction in permeability was caused by All-Bond DS followed by Sensodyne Dentin Desensitizer and Etch+Primers+Adhesive+RBC. Gluma Dentin Desensitizer, Etch+Primers, and Etch+Primers+Adhesive did not reduce permeability by a significant amount. Saliva immersion increased permeability significantly only for the Gluma and Etch+ Primers+Adhesive groups. There was a trend towards increase in permeability after toothbrushing; however, this increase was not statistically significant for any group (P> 0.05). Thus, placement of primers without etching (All-Bond DS) reduced permeability more than any other treatment modality. These data indicate that etching a sensitive dentin area may be appropriate only if RBC is to be placed in the area. Exposure to saliva and toothbrushing countered the decrease in permeability caused by dedicated desensitizers and dentin bonding agents. The SEM micrographs revealed that in most cases, form corroborated function and the morphology of the dentin surface corresponded to the dentin permeability values.

AB Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) imaging provides an indirect detection mechanism that allows quantification of certain labile groups unobservable using conventional MRI. Recently, amide proton transfer (APT) imaging, a variant form of CEST imaging, has been shown capable of detecting lactic acidosis during acute ischemia, providing information complementary to that of perfusion and diffusion MRI. However, CEST contrast is usually small, and therefore, it is important to optimize experimental conditions for reliable and quantitative CEST imaging. In particular, CEST imaging is sensitive to So and Ell field, while on the other hand; field inhomogeneities persist despite recent advances in magnet technologies, especially for in vivo imaging at high fields. Consequently, correction algorithms that can compensate for field inhomogeneity-induced measurement errors in CEST imaging might be very useful. In this study, the dependence of CEST contrast on field distribution was solved and a correction algorithm was developed to compensate for field inhomogeneity-induced CEST imaging artifacts. In addition, the proposed algorithm was verified with both numerical simulation and experimental measurements, and showed nearly complete correction of CEST imaging measurement errors caused by moderate field inhomogeneity.

AB Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for majority of cancer related deaths. Two major risk factors in induction of HCC are chemical and virus, however, the possible mechanisms of their differences remain indefinable. The current study focused on protective role of Fucoxanthin (Fx) in liver affected by diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC. In this study, levels of liver enzymes, oxidative stressors, antioxidant status, and lipoproteins were compared both in tissue and blood. Tissues were also analyzed extensively by histological studies using H and E staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Rats were clustered into four groups of six experimental animals. Group I: Control rats were administered isotonic saline intraperitoneal Group II: Animals received 0.01% DEN through drinking water to induce hepatocellular carcinoma. Group III: Animals received 0.01% DEN simultaneously oral supplementation of Fx (50 mg/kg b.w). Group IV: Rats were given Fx alone (50 mg/kg b.w) orally and the treatment is for 15 weeks. Results showed the decrease in body weight, serum albumin, antioxidant enzymes, and increased all the liver enzymes, serum bilirubin, and stress markers in DEN induced rats, where as the simultaneous supplementation of Fx reverted them to normal levels. Administration of only Fx did not show any change. Therefore, Fx may serve as a chemotherapeutic agent against liver cancer.

AB In this paper, we propose a control law to maneuver a group of mobile autonomous agents in the plane, where the information architecture among the agents is modeled by a directed graph. The objective is to achieve a prescribed formation shape by adjusting the inter-agent distances only, which is called the distance-based formation control. The proposed control law uses only relative position measurements so that each agent achieves its control objective in a decentralized manner. On the basis of the proposed control law, we analyze the convergence property of squared-distance errors. We first study a triangular formation and then extend the results of to acyclic minimally persistent formations having more than three agents. We also examine the formation including a moving leader. Numerical simulations and experiments with mobile robot platform are included.

   ADOLESCENTS; CONTEXT
AB Objectives. Unhealthy eating is a complex-system problem. We used agent-based modeling to examine the effects of different policies on unhealthy eating behaviors.
   Methods. We developed an agent-based simulation model to represent a synthetic population of adults in Pasadena, CA, and how they make dietary decisions. Data from the 2007 Food Attitudes and Behaviors Survey and other empirical studies were used to calibrate the parameters of the model. Simulations were performed to contrast the potential effects of various policies on the evolution of dietary decisions.
   Results. Our model showed that a 20% increase in taxes on fast foods would lower the probability of fast-food consumption by 3 percentage points, whereas improving the visibility of positive social norms by 10%, either through community-based or mass-media campaigns, could improve the consumption of fruits and vegetables by 7 percentage points and lower fast-food consumption by 6 percentage points. Zoning policies had no significant impact.
   Conclusions. Interventions emphasizing healthy eating norms may be more effective than directly targeting food prices or regulating local food outlets. Agent-based modeling may be a useful tool for testing the population-level effects of various policies within complex systems.

AB Caries, periodontal disease, and peri-implant inflammation caused by deficient marginal adaptation of fixed prostheses are reasons for clinical failure of combined tooth-implant-supported fixed dental prostheses (TISFDP). This in vitro study examined the marginal accuracy in TISFDP after simulated stress in an artificial oral environment.
   Twelve three-unit TISFDPs were fabricated using a high noble alloy on models containing a human premolar with an artificial periodontium and an implant. Four three-unit tooth-supported prostheses (TSFDP) represented the control group. The experimental TISFDPs (four per group) were luted with three different cements: group 1, zinc phosphate; group 2, glass ionomer; group 3, self-adhesive resin. The specimens were mechanically loaded (1.2 million cycles/50 N) and thermally cycled (8000 cycles with 5/55 degrees C). The vertical marginal gap was measured before and after cementation, after chewing simulation and after thermal cycling by light microscopy (x 560). The results were subjected to statistical analysis (t-test/one-way analysis of variance/Bonferroni).
   Significant increase (P <= 0.05) in the marginal gap was found after cementation within the experimental TISFDPs (implants, 11.7-18.7 mu m; teeth, 13.4-24.2 mu m) and the control TSFDPs (28.5 mu m). Comparison of groups 1 and 2 revealed significant differences for the teeth while comparison of the implants showed significant differences among all groups. Chewing simulation and thermal cycling caused statistically insignificant changes in the marginal gaps of the experimental as well as the control TSFDPs.
   The cementation of the TISFDPs with different luting materials caused a specific enlargement of the marginal gap in teeth and implants. Subsequent to simulated oral stress in an artificial oral environment, no significant changes of the marginal accuracy could be found.

TI The Combination of Pairwise and Group Interactions Promotes Consensus in

LA English
DT Article
AB In complex systems, agents often interact with others in two distinct types of interactions, pairwise interaction and group interaction. The Deffuant-Weisbuch model adopting pairwise interaction and the Hegselmann-Krause model adopting group interaction are the two most widely studied opinion dynamics. In this study, we propose a novel opinion dynamics by combining pairwise and group interactions for agents and study the effects of the combination on consensus in the population. In the model, we introduce a parameter alpha to control the weights of the two interactions in the dynamics. Through numerical simulations, we find that there exists an optimal alpha, which can lead to a highest probability of complete consensus and minimum critical bounded confidence for the formation of consensus. Furthermore, we show the effects of alpha on opinion formation by presenting the observations for opinion clusters. Moreover, we check the robustness of the results on different network structures and find the promotion of opinion consensus by alpha not limited to a complete graph.

ID EVACUATION
AB While the social sustainability of built environments is an essential aspect of architectural design education, systemic experiments still lack empirical pedagogy. Therefore, factors of social sustainability are hardly reflected in students' projects seamlessly. To overcome such limitations, this study investigates the applicability and effectiveness of human behavior simulation. To ensure authentic architectural design, the projects were equipped with autonomous, rational anthropomorphic computer agents called virtual users (VUsers). This study compared the performance scores on social sustainability factors, assessed by the students who conducted design projects both before (without) and after (with) using the simulation. A one-way analysis of variance indicated that human behavior simulation promoted the performance of projects with respect to the parameters of accessibility and safety, ergonomic usability for heterogeneous users and supportability of social interactions. However, the simulation was not found to be effective in promoting the physical attractiveness of built environments and in ensuring the completeness of design solutions. Based on previous studies, the present study interpreted the reasons why the operability of VUsers and built environments, representations of emerging interactions of VUsers and whole-and-part analytics promoted explicit experimentation, but the factors of physical attractiveness and completeness were irrelevant to the rational examinations in the use of the simulation.

TI Validating Human Behavior Representation Model of General Personnel
   During Offshore Emergency Situations
SO FIRE TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Behavior model validation; Human behavior representation; Behavior
   simulation; Validating intelligent agents; Offshore emergency response
AB With the advancement of simulation-based training, intelligent agents that can display human-like behavior have become common. From military combat simulations to nuclear power plant simulation, agents have been widely used to facilitate team training (as team mates, opponents, or both). Credibility of these agents is vital to ensure a sound training process. Credibility of the agents largely depends on the credibility of the underlying human behavior representation (HBR) model. This is why validation of the HBR model is necessary to ensure realistic agent behavior. However, the non-deterministic nature of the HBR and the subjectivity in experts' judgment during the validation process make HBR model validation more challenging compared to physics based models. This paper presents the validation process of an HBR model of general personnel created for use in an offshore emergency training simulator. Three types of agents (naive, in-between, and ideal) are created in the simulator using the HBR model. The paper discusses the use of empirical evidence as referents, along with subject matter experts. A two-level three factor experiment was conducted using 36 participants. Several performance metrics were collected during the experiment, including route selected for evacuation, time to muster, time spent running, interaction with fire doors and watertight doors, interaction with hazards, and reporting to the muster station. Data collected during the experimental study have been used in this paper to demonstrate how the use of empirical evidence can facilitate HBR validation. High-level tasks performed during HBR validation are discussed in detail. Special emphasis is given on acceptability criteria testing to ensure that the HBR model performs adequately under different operating conditions. Results show that the proposed HBR model meets the acceptability criteria requirement for all types of agents. In general, the ideal agents exhibited safe behavior during offshore emergency egress, whereas the naive and in-between agents showed erroneous behavior at times. For example, during the simulation runs of a critical emergency scenario where the primary egress route was obstructed by a hazard, the ideal agents either waited and listened to the public address announcement and followed an alternative egress route (60% cases), or they initially chose their preferred route but re-routed immediately after encountering the hazard (40% cases). In all cases, the in-between agents started with their preferred route and re-routed after encountering the hazard, and the naive agents proceeded with their preferred route even when the route was compromised.

AB One of the most challenging issues when facing a Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) classification model is to deal with the descriptor selection. Penalized methods have been adapted and have gained popularity as a key for simultaneously performing descriptor selection and QSAR classification model estimation. However, penalized methods have drawbacks such as having biases and inconsistencies that make they lack the oracle properties. This paper proposes an adaptive penalized logistic regression (APLR) to overcome these drawbacks. This is done by employing a ratio (BWR) of the descriptors between-groups sum of squares (BSS) to the within-groups sum of squares (WSS) for each descriptor as a weight inside the L-1-norm. The proposed method was applied to one dataset that consists of a diverse series of antimicrobial agents with their respective bioactivities againstCandida albicans. By experimental study, it has been shown that the proposed method (APLR) was more efficient in the selection of descriptors and classification accuracy than the other competitive methods that could be used in developing QSAR classification models. Another dataset was also successfully experienced. Therefore, it can be concluded that the APLR method had significant impact on QSAR analysis and studies.

AB The Rayleigh-Plesset (RP) equation for a clean gas bubble in an incompressible and infinite liquid has previously been applied to approximately simulate the behavior of ultrasound contrast agents (UCA) in vivo, and extended RP equations have been proposed to account for the effects of the UCA shell or surrounding soft tissue. These models produce results that are consistent with experimental measurements for low acoustic pressure scenarios. For applications of UCAs in therapeutic medicine, the transmitted acoustic pulse can have a peak negative pressure (PNP) up to a few megapascals, resulting in discrepancies between measurements and predictions using these extended RP equations. Here, a model was developed to describe the dynamics of UCAs in vivo while taking account of the effects of liquid compressibility, the shell and the surrounding tissue. Liquid compressibility is approximated to first order and the shell is treated either as a Voigt viscoelastic solid or a Newtonian viscous liquid. Finite deformation of the shell and tissue is derived. Dynamics of UCAs with a shell of lipid, polymer, albumin and liquid are investigated for typical therapeutic ultrasound pulses. The effects of liquid compressibility and shell and tissue parameters are analyzed. (c) 2010 Acoustical Society of America. [DOI: 10.1121/1.3409476]

AB Interactive effects of complex agents, including citric acid (CA), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) on the electroplating behavior of Sn-Bi deposits from a basic bath containing 0.15 M Sn2+ and 0.05 M Bi3+ with pH 2, were systematically compared by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) analyses. The onset potential of Bi deposition is obviously shifted to a negative value close to that of Sn deposition by the simultaneous addition of the above three compounds into the basic plating solution. Based on the LSV results, the composition of Sn-Bi deposits with Sn varying from 44 to 96 wt % can be controlled by varying the current density of electroplating and the concentration of EDTA from the basic plating bath containing 0.3 M CA and 0.2 M PEG. This plating bath provides a reliable route to obtain Sn-Bi alloys of high Sn content (e.g., 80Sn-20Bi and 90Sn-10Bi) and the eutectic 42Sn-58Bi deposit. Tin-bismuth deposits plated from the basic bath with different combinations of the above three complex agents were also characterized by scanning electron microscopic and energy-dispersive spectroscopic analyses.

AB A modified double contrast barium enema using carboxymethylcellulose was evaluated in beagle dogs and compared with dogs receiving a conventional barium enema. The experimental group was divided into three groups (1, 2, and 3) and given 30 ml/kg of different volume ratios of a barium vs. carboxymethylcellulose mixture. Each group underwent sonography following radiography. The volume ratio of one part barium to three parts carboxymethylcellulose was judged to be the optimal mixture, resulting in a general distribution of contrast and bowel radiolucency on radiographs and adequate postradiography sonography. The modified barium enema using carboxymethylcellulose is useful for assessing the general morphology and mucosal layers of the colon simultaneously on radiographs and ultrasonographs.

AB Using evolutionary simulations, we develop autonomous agents controlled by artificial neural networks (ANNs). In simple life-like tasks of foraging and navigation, high performance levels are attained by agents equipped with fully-recurrent ANN controllers. Examining several experimental settings, differing in the sensory input available to the agents, we find a common structure of a "command neuron" switching the dynamics of the network between radically different behavioural modes. In some of the models the command neuron reflects a map of the environment, acting as a "place cell". In others it is based on a spontaneously evolving short-term memory mechanism. The resemblance to known findings from neurobiology places Evolved ANNs as an excellent candidate model for the study of structure and function relation in complex nervous systems.

AB The reaction of o-benzoquinone derived by the oxidation of catechols (I a-c) with some nucleophiles containing thiol group (2a-f) has been studied in various conditions, such as pH, nucleophile concentration, and scan rate, using cyclic voltammetry. In various conditions, based on an EC electrochemical mechanism ("E" represents an electron transfer at the electrode surface and "C" represents a homogeneous chemical reaction), the observed homogeneous rate constants (k(obs)) were estimated by comparison of the experimental cyclic voltammetric responses with the digital simulated results for each of the nucleophile. The results show that the magnitude of k(obs) is dependent on the nature of the substituted group on the catechol ring and nucleophilicity of nucleophile. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Social working memory (SWM) plays an important role in navigating social interactions. Inspired by studies in psychology, neuroscience, cognitive science, and machine learning, we propose a probabilistic model of SWM to mimic human social intelligence for personal information retrieval (IR) in social interactions. First, we establish a semantic hierarchy as social long-term memory to encode personal information. Next, we propose a semantic Bayesian network as the SWM, which integrates the cognitive functions of accessibility and self-regulation. One subgraphical model implements the accessibility function to learn the social consensus about IR-based on social information concept, clustering, social context, and similarity between persons. Beyond accessibility, one more layer is added to simulate the function of self-regulation to perform the personal adaptation to the consensus based on human personality. Two learning algorithms are proposed to train the probabilistic SWM model on a raw dataset of high uncertainty and incompleteness. One is an efficient learning algorithm of Newton's method, and the other is a genetic algorithm. Systematic evaluations show that the proposed SWM model is able to learn human social intelligence effectively and outperforms the baseline Bayesian cognitive model. Toward real-world applications, we implement our model on Google Glass as a wearable assistant for social interaction.

AB The development of antimicrobial agents that target and selectively disrupt biofilms is a pressing issue since, so far, no antibiotics have been developed that achieve this effectively. Previous experimental work has found a promising set of antibacterial peptides: beta(2,2)-amino acid derivatives, relatively small molecules with common structural elements composed of a polar head group and two non-polar hydrocarbon arms. In order to develop insight into possible mechanisms of action of these novel antibacterial agents, we have performed an in silico investigation of four leading beta(2,2)-amino acid derivatives, interacting with models of both bacterial (target) and eukaryotic (host) membranes, using molecular dynamics simulation with a model with all-atom resolution. We found an unexpected result that could shed light on the mechanism of action of these antimicrobial agents: the molecules assume a conformation where one of the hydrophobic arms is directed downward into the membrane core while the other is directed upwards, out of the membrane and exposed above the position of the membrane headgroups; we dubbed this conformation the "can-can pose". Intriguingly, the can-can pose was most closely linked to the choice of headgroup. Also, the compound previously found to be most effective against biofilms displayed the strongest extent of this behavior and, additionally, this behavior was more pronounced for this compound in the bacterial than in the eukaryotic membrane. We hypothesize that adopting the can-can pose could possibly disrupt the protective peptidoglycan macronet found on the exterior of the bacterial membrane.

AB A geochemical model is developed for the immobilization of U in the presence of metallic Fe. Zero-valent iron (ZVI) serves as a reducing agent inducing the reductive-precipitation of U, and ZVI corrosion products can serve as absorbing agents for U. The numerical model developed allows the complex interactions of U in solution in differing concentrations to be examined, under variable pH and redox conditions, with or without carbonate, in the presence of ZVI of different size and surface area. It incorporates Fe corrosion, Fe(II) and Fe(III) corrosion product formation, reductive-precipitation of U from the soluble U(VI) valence to the poorly soluble U(IV) valence, adsorption/de-sorption of U onto the Fe oxide corrosion products, and aqueous speciation. The processes of Fe corrosion and reductive precipitation of U are simulated as non-equilibrium, an improvement over other geochemical models. The reductive-precipitation process may use either ZVI or Fe(II) as the reducing agent. The model is calibrated using 3 separate sets of experimental data from published literature that cover a wide range of redox conditions. Sensitivity of the model predictions to variations in input parameters is examined. The simulation results show that the different published experimental results can be explained by different solution chemistries in the studies, specifically O-2 and CO2 availability and pH, and the amount and surface area of the metallic Fe. With this numerical model the behavior of U in ZVI containing systems over a range of conditions realistic for groundwater can be investigated. By synthesizing observations across several experimental studies,. it will lead to a broader understanding of the processes controlling U immobilization under varied geochemical conditions.

AB Objective: The object of this study was to evaluate the simulated pulpal pressure (SPP) and immediate dentin sealing technique (IDS) effects on the microtensile bond strength (mu TBS) and nanoleakage of interfaces produced by different luting agents.
   Methods and Materials: Two self-adhesive luting agents (RelyX Unicem [UC] and Clearfil SA Luting [SA]) and two conventional luting agents (Rely X ARC [RX] and Panavia F [PF]) were evaluated. Eighty human molars were divided in four groups according to luting agents. Each group was subdivided according to SPP (with or without) and dentin sealing (immediate or delayed) using Clearfil SE Bond (n=5). After IDS was performed, specimens were stored in water for seven days before luting procedures. Composite blocks were luted according to the manufacturers' instructions. One half of the specimens were subjected to 15 cm H2O of hydrostatic pressure for 24 hours before cementation procedures and continued for 24 hours afterward. Then, restored teeth were sectioned into beams and tested in tension. Two additional teeth per group were prepared for nanoleakage evaluation with scanning electron microscopy. Bond strength data were statistically analyzed by three-way analysis of variance and Tukey test.
   Results: mu TBS of RX decreased when it was subjected to SPP without IDS. However, in the same conditions, mu TBS of UC increased. The IDS prevented negative influence of SPP on mu TBS of RX and PF; however, a decrease in mu TBS of SA and UC was observed. Except for RX, IDS increased mu TBS for all resin cements.
   Conclusion: Independent of SPP, the IDS technique obtained higher mu TBS for PF, SA, and UC and did not influence RX mu TBS.

AB This article introduces an innovative approach to the validation of empirical methods aiming at estimating capabilities. Validating these empirical methods is difficult because capabilities are not directly observable. We propose a computational model to generate data from a simulated society, where we observe both functionings and capabilities. These data can then be used to compare estimation methods against each other. Most importantly, our data generating process is completely disconnected from any estimation procedure and can, therefore, be used to compare a variety of methods. The model is calibrated to the Mexican economy and coherently reproduces many stylised facts of this economy. The article also proposes a short illustrative analysis on how to use the simulated data and a section on how this can be implemented practically.

AB Mathematical modeling has become a valuable tool that strives to complement conventional biomedical research modalities in order to predict experimental outcome, generate new medical hypotheses, and optimize clinical therapies. Two specific approaches, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) modeling, and agent-based modeling (ABM), have been widely applied in cancer research. While they have made important contributions on their own (e.g., PK-PD in examining chemotherapy drug efficacy and resistance, and ABM in describing and predicting tumor growth and metastasis), only a few groups have started to combine both approaches together in an effort to gain more insights into the details of drug dynamics and the resulting impact on tumor growth. In this review, we focus our discussion on some of the most recent modeling studies building on a combined PK-PD and ABM approach that have generated experimentally testable hypotheses. Some future directions are also discussed.

AB In most deregulated power markets, firms bid daily into a day-ahead power market. The auction mechanism, supply and demand, determine the equilibrium at each hour. In this environment, firms aim to maximize their revenues by carefully determining their bids. This requires the development of effective computational methods that help them estimate their competitors' behaviors under incomplete information. In this article an agent-based method that uses particle swarm optimization is described to simulate the behavior of market participants. Particle swarm optimization is used in the bidding process and an agent-based model is applied to find a Nash equilibrium. Different stopping conditions are used to determine the equilibrium. Experimental results are presented for two power systems.

AB We address the problem of a participatory decision-making process where a shared priority list of alternatives has to be obtained while avoiding inconsistent decisions. An agent-based model (ABM) is proposed to mimic this process in different social networks of stakeholders who interact according to an opinion dynamics model. Simulations' results show the efficacy of interaction in finding a transitive and, above all, shared decision. These findings are in agreement with real participation experiences regarding transport planning decisions and can give useful suggestions on how to plan an effective participation process for sustainable policy-making based on opinion consensus.

AB The present work provides new insights into the behavior of air bubbles in non-Newtonian fluids. The interactions and coalescence between bubbles rising in non-Newtonian fluids were simultaneously investigated by means of birefringence measurements and particle image velocimetry for a chain of bubbles formed from a submerged orifice. Two aspects are identified for the first time as central to interactions and coalescence: (i) the stress creation by the passage of bubbles, and (ii) their relaxation due to the fluid's memory. This competition displays complex nonlinear dynamics, from periodic phenomena to deterministic chaos. From these fundamental mechanisms, a cognitive model based on behavioral rules has been developed to describe collective behaviors of a group of bubbles. By simulating bubbles as adaptive agents with their fluid via residual stresses, model predictions for consecutive coalescence between a great number of bubbles compare very satisfactorily with the experimental investigation.

SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-PLANNING & DESIGN
LA English

ID NEIGHBORHOOD RACIAL SEGREGATION; PREFERENCES; BLACKS
AB This paper deals with the influence of the organization of an agent's ethnic identities on ethnic residential patterns by extending the Schelling model to include a further hierarchical level; that is, the agents' ethnic identities are organized in a two-level hierarchy (each agent belongs to an ethnic group and subgroup). Agent-based simulation reveals that the residential pattern created at given levels of ethnic residential distribution can also be a response to intolerance behaviour at another level. The simulation experiments also show that these patterns can qualitatively change in response to different intensities of intolerance at both and/or either level. However, as a result of the asymmetric nesting of agents' ethnic identities and the tangible residential patterns subsequently established, top-down and bottom-up influences are generally displayed in the following form; intolerance behaviour at the top level strengthens the segregation observed at the bottom level whereas intolerance behaviour at the bottom level tends to weaken the segregation observed at the top level. This means that intolerance-motivated segregation between a minority and a majority in a city tends to strengthen segregation between ethnic subgroups within an ethnic minority community. Conversely, mutual intolerance between ethnic subgroups within an ethnic minority tends to moderate residential segregation between that minority community and the majority population. I suggest that these conclusions can be used empirically to evaluate the consequences of individual preferences for the ethnic composition characterizing residential patterns.

AB Research has shown that the observation of another's movement activates the corresponding motor representation in the observer. However, it is largely unknown how activation of these shared representations is influenced by the number of observed agents. In recent work, we have studied automatic imitation while participants saw 2 hands of which either one hand or both hands made a movement. These studies found that 2 hands produced a stronger imitative response than a single hand when the hands made an identical movement but not when they made different movements. It was argued that identical movements were mapped onto the same motor representation and therefore produced a stronger motor response. Nevertheless, an alternative explanation is that participants randomly represented 1 hand on each trial. The goal of the current study was to disentangle these 2 hypotheses. In Experiments 1 and 2, we replicate our results using a stimulus setup that made random sampling unlikely. In Experiment 3, we show that an additive effect was still present when attention was directed to 1 hand that always made a movement. Finally, in Experiment 4, we show that intentional imitation of 1 hand did not preclude automatic imitation of a second hand. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that the actions of multiple persons can be represented together in the motor system.

AB This study was an examination of how the preferences of a negotiator are formed in bargaining situations in which an individual represents a group of individuals.  The experiment used a policy-capturing approach within the context of a collective bargaining simulation.  The literature on industrial relations, principal-agent relations, managerial intravention, and frustration-regression mechanisms was used to construct the simulation.  These procedures also enabled a test of the voice mechanism that is hypothesized for unions.  The importance of a bargaining issue to a union negotiator was determined by the following four cues (in decreasing order of importance):  member preferences, management's capacity to concede the demands, the national union's support, and management's resistance to the issue.  Results indicated support for the voice mechanism.  Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

AB The present study aimed to determine the impact of different sealant materials on histopathological changes to the liver surface after liver resection. Thirty-six landrace pigs underwent left anatomical hemihepatectomy and were assigned to a histopathological control group (HPC, n = 9) with no bleeding control, a clinically simulated control group (CSC, n = 9) with no sealant but bipolar cauterization and oversewing of the liver surface, and two treatment groups (n = 9 each) with a collagen-based sealant (CBS) or a fibrinogen-based sealant (FBS) on resection surface. After postoperative day 6, tissue samples were histologically examined. There were no significant differences in preoperative parameters between the groups. Fibrin production was higher in sealant groups compared with the HPC and CSC groups (both p < 0.001). Hepatocellular regeneration in sealant groups was higher than in both control groups. A significantly higher regeneration was seen in the FBS group. Use of sealants increased the degree of fibrin exudation at the resection plane. Increased hepatocellular necrosis was seen in the CBS group compared with the FBS group. The posthepatectomy hepatocellular regeneration rate was higher in the FBS group compared with the CBS group. Randomized studies are needed to assess the impact of sealants on posthepatectomy liver regeneration in the clinical setting.

AB This paper proposes a multivariable fixed-time leader-follower formation control method for a group of nonholonomic mobile robots, which has the ability to estimate multiple uncertainties. Firstly, based on the state space model of the leader-follower formation, a multivariable fixed-time formation kinematics controller is designed. Secondly, to overcome uncertainties existing in the nonholonomic mobile robot system, such as load change, friction, external disturbance, a multivariable fixed-time torque controller based on the fixed-time disturbance observer at the dynamic level is designed. The designed torque controller is cascaded with the formation controller and finally realizes accurate estimation of the uncertain part of the system, the follower tracking of reference velocity and the desired formation of the leader and the follower in a fixed-time. The fixed-time upper bound is completely determined by the controller parameters, which is independent of the initial state of the system. The multivariable fixed-time control theory and the Lyapunov method are adopted to ensure the system stability. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by the experimental simulation.

AB This paper presents an agent-based spatial simulation of shifting cultivation applied to savannah landscape in North-Cameroon (Duupa ethnic community). The model is based on empirical rules and was developed by a team who seek to create interdisciplinary dynamics by combining domain specific approaches to the same subject. The manner in which the model is described in this paper reflects the interdisciplinary processes that guided its development. It is made up of four domain-specific modules - demography, agriculture, savannah regrowth and social rules - which converge to form a fifth one, i.e., the evolution of the mosaic of cultivated fields. The focus is on how the spatial organization of landscapes results of environmental and social interactions. Two scenarios are presented in this paper. The first simulates the transformation of savannah woodland into a shifting cultivation savannah landscape. The second simulates changes in the landscape and socio-demographic structure of a Duupa village over a 60-year period. The simulation results are used to identify some of the key aspects of the socio-environmental interactions and help to explain why at large spatial scales and over a long period of time, the composition and structure of a landscape appear rather stable. For instance, it is well known that demography plays a key role in both social and environmental dynamics of shifting cultivation systems. Yet, in the case of the Duupa system, we show that social resilience can be acquired through interactions between demographic cycles of rising and falling population levels and a socioeconomic redistribution system. Finally, we compare the model developed with other shifting cultivation models and provide some insights on future developments.

AB A financial agent-based price model is developed by a combination of the contact system and the social network theory. Agents are supposed to live on a small-world network described by the Watts-Strogatz model and their attitude interinfluences along the network are characterized by particle interactions in the Markov contact process. The financial time series of the model are generated by Monte Carlo simulations and analysed with respect to a number of "stylized facts'', focusing on the role played by network topology. Return series of the model can reproduce nonnormality, volatility clustering and multifractality, consistent with an empirical observation of real market data. And these "stylized facts'' are most salient when the model is of the small-world network topology rather than completely ordered or random one in our experiments, highlighting a potential influence of the structure of agent attitude exchange channel on financial price fluctuation behaviours.

AB Background Current practices for fluorescence-guided cancer surgery utilize a single fluorescent agent, but homogeneous distribution throughout the tumor is difficult to achieve. We hypothesize that administering a perfusion and a molecular-targeted agent at their optimal administration-to-imaging time will improve whole-tumor contrast. Experimental Design Mice bearing subcutaneous xenograft human synovial sarcomas were administered indocyanine green (ICG) (3 mg/kg) or ABY-029 (48.7 mu g/kg)-an epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted Affibody molecule-alone or in combination. Fluorescence contrast and signal distribution were compared between treatment groups. Two commercial fluorescence imaging systems were tested for simultaneous imaging of ICG and ABY-029. Results ABY-029 has a moderate positive correlation with viable tumor (rho = 0.2 +/- 0.4), while ICG demonstrated a strong negative correlation (rho = -0.6 +/- 0.1). The contrast-to-variance ratio was highest in the ABY-029 +ICG (2.5 +/- 0.8), compared to animals that received ABY-029 (2.3 +/- 0.8) or ICG (2.0 +/- 0.5) alone. Moreover, the combination of ABY-029 + ICG minimizes the correlation between viable tumor and fluorescence intensity (rho = -0.1 +/- 0.2) indicating the fluorescence signal distribution is more homogeneous throughout the tumor milieu. Conclusion Dual-agent imaging utilizing a single channel in a commercial fluorescence-guided imaging system tailored for IRDye 800CW is a promising method to increase tumor contrast in a clinical setting.

AB The paper defines the core components of an interactive-phonetic (IP) sound change model. The starting point for the IP-model is that a phonological category is often skewed phonetically in a certain direction by the production and perception of speech. A prediction of the model is that sound change is likely to come about as a result of perceiving phonetic variants in the direction of the skew and at the probabilistic edge of the listener's phonological category. The results of agent-based computational simulations applied to the sound change in progress, /u/-fronting in Standard Southern British, were consistent with this hypothesis. The model was extended to sound changes involving splits and mergers by using the interaction between the agents to drive the phonological reclassification of perceived speech signals. The simulations showed no evidence of any acoustic change when this extended model was applied to Australian English data in which /s/ has been shown to retract due to coarticulation in /str/ clusters. Some agents nevertheless varied in their phonological categorizations during interaction between /str/ and /?tr/: This vacillation may represent the potential for sound change to occur. The general conclusion is that many types of sound change are the outcome of how phonetic distributions are oriented with respect to each other, their association to phonological classes, and how these types of information vary between speakers that happen to interact with each other.
   Using agent-based modelling, Harrington, Kleber, Reubold, Schiel & Stevens (2018) develop a unified model of sound change based on cognitive processing of human speech and theories of how social factors constrain the spread of change throughout a community. They conclude that many types of change result from how biases in the phonetic distribution of phonological categories are transmitted via accommodation processes between individuals in interaction.

AB Porous ceramic materials can be produced by different techniques. One of the most important is pore agent method. The pore fraction, size, shape and distribution are linked to the pore-forming agent. In these materials porosity has a great influence in their physical properties and one of them is thermal conductivity. The role of the pore size distribution has been studied much less than pore fraction, probably because it is very difficult to describe and to characterize it. For this reason, in this paper, an original intermingled fractal model to predict thermal conductivity (taking into account entirely pore size distribution) has been proposed. This model is capable to reproduce fractal or non-fractal microstructure. Calculated data are in good agreement with experimental ones. The model could be considered as a microstructure simulator to improve thermal performance of porous ceramic materials. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper an innovative tool is applied for the detection of electoral fraud by analyzing statistical distributions of the official results. With this aim a computational model is developed to describe the dynamics of an electoral campaign that conditions the individuals' political preferences. The agent-based model is built assuming that in a clean process the electoral outcome depends, essentially, on preferences subjected to the influence of social interaction and global information. In contrast, in order to simulate an electoral fraud the model is modified such that the voting behavior of the citizens is manipulated on election-day. The model is calibrated with data form the 2006 Mexican electoral campaign for the presidency, and the presence or absence of fraud is validated using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, a non-parametric procedure. With information aggregated at the electoral district level, the simulation model rejects the existence of a large scale fraud where at least 5-6% of the total vote tally is manipulated in favor of a particular candidate.

ID SEARCH; ROBOTS; NAVIGATION; EFFICIENCY; COVERAGE
AB In this work, a swarm behaviour for multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) deployment will be presented. The main contribution of this behaviour is the use of a virtual device for quantitative sematectonic stigmergy providing more adaptable behaviours in complex environments. It is a fault tolerant highly robust behaviour that does not require prior information of the area to be covered, or to assume the existence of any kind of information signals (GPS, mobile communication networks...), taking into account the specific features of UAVs. This behaviour will be oriented towards emergency tasks. Their main goal will be to cover an area of the environment for later creating an ad-hoc communication network, that can be used to establish communications inside this zone. Although there are several papers on robotic deployment it is more difficult to find applications with UAV systems, mainly because of the existence of various problems that must be overcome including limitations in available sensory and on-board processing capabilities and low flight endurance. In addition, those behaviours designed for UAVs often have significant limitations on their ability to be used in real tasks, because they assume specific features, not easily applicable in a general way. Firstly, in this article the characteristics of the simulation environment will be presented. Secondly, a microscopic model for deployment and creation of ad-hoc networks, that implicitly includes stigmergy features, will be shown. Then, the overall swarm behaviour will be modeled, providing a macroscopic model of this behaviour. This model can accurately predict the number of agents needed to cover an area as well as the time required for the deployment process. An experimental analysis through simulation will be carried out in order to verify our models. In this analysis the influence of both the complexity of the environment and the stigmergy system will be discussed, given the data obtained in the simulation. In addition, the macroscopic and microscopic models will be compared verifying the number of predicted individuals for each state regarding the simulation.

AB Here we report molecular level details regarding the adsorption of sarin (GB) gas in a prototypical zirconium-based metal-organic framework (MOF, UiO-66). By combining predictive modeling and experimental spectroscopic techniques, we unambiguously identify several unique bindings sites within the MOF, using the P=O stretch frequency of GB as a probe. Remarkable agreement between predicted and experimental IR spectrum is demonstrated. As previously hypothesized, the undercoordinated Lewis acid metal site is the most favorable binding site. Yet multiple sites participate in the adsorption process; specifically, the Zr-chelated hydroxyl groups form hydrogen bonds with the GB molecule, and GB weakly interacts with fully coordinated metals. Importantly, this work highlights that subtle orientational effects of bound GB are observable via shifts in characteristic vibrational modes; this finding has large implications for degradation rates and opens a new route for future materials design.

AB Computer simulation is an effective tool for assessing mitigation strategies, with recent trends concentrating on agent-based techniques. These methods require high computational efforts in order to simulate enough scenarios for statistical significance. The population individuals and their contacts determined by agent-based simulations form a social network. For some network structures it is possible to gain high accuracy estimates of contagion spread based on the connection structure of the network, an idea that is utilized in this work. A representative social network constructed from the 2006 census of the Greater Toronto Area (Ontario, Canada) of 5 million individuals in 1.8 million households is used to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. We examine the effects of six mitigation strategies with respect to their ability to contain disease spread as indicated by pre- and post-vaccination reproduction numbers, mean local clustering coefficients and degree distributions. One outcome of the analysis provides evidence supporting the design of mitigation strategies that aim to fragment the population into similarly sized components. While our analysis is framed in the context of pandemic disease spread, the approach is applicable to any contagion such as computer viruses, rumours, social trends, and so on. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Methylphosphonate (MP)-substituted antisense DNA oligomers have significant Potential for genome targeted therapy. The physicochemical basis of the difference in R- versus S-MP diastereomers incorporated into DNA oligomers with regard to complementary DNA target hybridization has been poorly understood. State of the art advanced molecular computational methods and supercomputer technology were applied to identify key physicochemical determinants involved in stabilizing and destabilizing target hybridization. MP-oligomer:DNA target hybridization is more stable with R-MP substitution and is due to favorable hydrophobic interactions between the equatorial projecting methyl group and water molecules. S-MP destabilizes the double strand helix formation by less favorable local hydrophobic interactions with waters, which result in DNA helix unwinding, and by promoting local changes from C2' endo to C3' endo in the 5' furanose ring. In the oligomer studied, R-MP thymine is more stable than R-MP uracil, resulting from hydrophobic interaction to locally stabilize the helix due to the presence of the pyrimidine C5 methyl group. The presence of the C5 methyl group in thymine also appears to influence helical winding and the local conformation of the furanose ring. These numerical simulations are supported by experimental data, enabling us to propose several mechanisms which underlie some of the experimental observations. These results support further development of diastereomerically pure MP analogues as diagnostic/therapeutic agents involving sequence-specific DNA interactions.

AB Background: The current study was carried out to evaluate the effects of mycotoxin biodegradation agent (MBA, composed of Bacillus subtilis ANSB01G and Devosia sp. ANSB714) on relieving zearalenone (ZEA) and deoxynivalenol (DON) toxicosis in immature gilts.
   Methods: A total of forty pre-pubertal female gilts (61.42 +/- 1.18 kg) were randomly allocated to four diet treatments: CO (positive control); MO (negative control, ZEA 596.86 mu g/kg feed and DON 796 mu g/kg feed); COA (CO + 2 g MBA/kg feed); MOA (MO + 2 g MBA/kg feed). Each treatment contained 10 replicates with 1 gilt per replicate. Gilts were housed in an environmentally controlled room with the partially slatted floor.
   Results: During the entire experimental period of 28 d, average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) of gilts in MO group was significantly reduced compared with those in CO group. The vulva size of gilts was significantly higher in MO group than CO group. In addition, significant increases in the plasma levels of IgA, IgG, IL-8, IL-10 and PRL were determined in MO group compared with that in CO group. ZEA and DON in the diet upregulated apoptotic caspase-3 in ovaries and uteri, along with down-regulated the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in ovaries. The supplementation of MBA into diets co-contaminated with ZEA and DON significantly increased ADG, decreased the vulva sizes, reduced the levels of IgG, IL-8 and PRL in plasma, and regulated apoptosis in ovaries and uteri of gilts.
   Conclusions: The present results indicated that feeding diet contaminated with ZEA and DON simultaneously (596.86 mu g/kg + 796 mu g/kg) had detrimental effects on growth performance, plasma immune function and reproductive status of gilts. And MBA could reduce the negative impacts of these two toxins, believed as a promising feed additive for mitigating toxicosis of ZEA and DON at low levels in gilts.

AB Waggle dancing bees provide nestmates with spatial information about high quality resources. Surprisingly, attempts to quantify the benefits of this encoded spatial information have failed to find positive effects on colony foraging success under many ecological circumstances. Experimental designs have often involved measuring the foraging success of colonies that were repeatedly switched between oriented dances versus disoriented dances (i.e. communicating vectors versus not communicating vectors). However, if recruited bees continue to visit profitable food sources for more than one day, this procedure would lead to confounded results because of the long-term effects of successful recruitment events. Using agent-based simulations, we found that spatial information was beneficial in almost all ecological situations. Contrary to common belief, the benefits of recruitment increased with environmental stability because benefits can accumulate over time to outweigh the short-term costs of recruitment. Furthermore, we found that in simulations mimicking previous experiments, the benefits of communication were considerably underestimated (at low food density) or not detected at all (at medium and high densities). Our results suggest that the benefits of waggle dance communication are currently underestimated and that different experimental designs, which account for potential long-term benefits, are needed to measure empirically how spatial information affects colony foraging success.

AB Network applications are increasingly required to be autonomous, scalable, adaptive to dynamic changes in the network, and survivable against partial system failures. Based on the observation that various biological systems have already satisfied these requirements, this article proposes and evaluates a biologically-inspired framework that makes network applications to be autonomous, scalable, adaptive, and survivable. With the proposed framework, called iNet, each network application is designed as a decentralized group of software agents, analogous to a bee colony (application) consisting of multiple bees (agents). Each agent provides a particular functionality of a network application, and implements biological behaviors such as reproduction, migration, energy exchange, and death. iNet is designed after the mechanisms behind how the immune system detects antigens (e. g., viruses) and produces specific antibodies to eliminate them. It models a set of environment conditions (e. g., network traffic and resource availability) as an antigen and an agent behavior (e. g., migration) as an antibody. iNet allows each agent to autonomously sense its surrounding environment conditions (an antigen) to evaluate whether it adapts well to the sensed environment, and if it does not, adaptively perform a behavior (an antibody) suitable for the environment conditions. In iNet, a configuration of antibodies is encoded as a set of genes, and antibodies evolve via genetic operations such as crossover and mutation. Empirical measurement results show that iNet is lightweight enough. Simulation results show that agents adapt to dynamic and heterogeneous network environments by evolving their antibodies across generations. The results also show that iNet allows agents to scale to workload volume and network size and to survive partial link failures in the network.

DT Article
ID HIGH-RISK PATIENTS; WAX; INFECTION; GRANULOMA; SURGERY; AGENT
AB Background: Bone wax is traditionally used as part of surgical procedures to prevent bleeding from exposed spongy bone. It is an effective hemostatic device which creates a physical barrier. Unfortunately it interferes with subsequent bone healing and increases the risk of infection in experimental studies. Recently, a water-soluble, synthetic, hemostatic compound (Ostene (R)) was introduced to serve the same purpose as bone wax without hampering bone healing. This study aims to compare sternal healing after application of either bone wax or Ostene (R).
   Methods: Twenty-four pigs were randomized into one of three treatment groups: Ostene (R), bone wax or no hemostatic treatment (control). Each animal was subjected to midline sternotomy. Either Ostene (R) or bone wax was applied to the spongy bone surfaces until local hemostasis was ensured. The control group received no hemostatic treatment. The wound was left open for 60 min before closing to simulate conditions alike those of cardiac surgery. All sterni were harvested 6 weeks after intervention.
   Bone density and the area of the bone defect were determined with peripheral quantitative CT-scanning; bone healing was displayed with plain X-ray and chronic inflammation was histologically assessed.
   Results: Both CT-scanning and plain X-ray disclosed that bone healing was significantly impaired in the bone wax group (p < 0.01) compared with the other two groups, and the former group had significantly more chronic inflammation (p < 0.01) than the two latter.
   Conclusion: Bone wax inhibits bone healing and induces chronic inflammation in a porcine model. Ostene (R) treated animals displayed bone healing characteristics and inflammatory reactions similar to those of the control group without application of a hemostatic agent.

Research on price negotiation and insurance selling suggests-consequences in terms of agent/consumer behavior, attitudes, and perception. Hypotheses are evaluated in an experimental simulation of the life insurance sales situation under different rebating conditions. Evidence suggests little actual rebating but a tendency for consumers to delay purchase as a bargaining ploy. Consumers' psychological reactions are found to be contingent on their price negotiation orientation and insurance involvement. Female negotiators and highly involved males are favorable, while others are unfavorable. Agents have a negative evaluation of participating in price negotiation and question the effectiveness of sales interaction.

AB A motility mechanism based on a simple exclusion process, where the probability of movement of an agent depends on the number of unoccupied nearest-neighbor sites is considered. Such interacting agents are termed myopic. This problem is an extension of the famous blind or myopic ant in a labyrinth problem. For the interacting agent models considered here, each agent plays the role of an ant in a labyrinth, where the paths of allowed sites though the labyrinth consist of sites not occupied by other agents. We derive a nonlinear diffusion equation for the average occupancy of the discrete agent-based model for myopic agents. In contrast, interacting blind agents have a constant probability of movement to each of their nearest-neighbor sites, giving rise to a linear diffusion equation. Insight into the various terms in the nonlinear diffusion coefficient is obtained from a study of multiple subpopulations of interacting myopic agents, where an advection-diffusion equation for each subpopulation is derived, and from tracking an individual agent within the crowd, where a motility coefficient is extracted. Averaged discrete simulation data compares very well with the solution to the continuum models. We also compare the behavior of myopic and blind agents. The myopic motility mechanism is biologically motivated to emulate information an individual cell gathers from environment cues. The multispecies model developed and investigated here assists with the interpretation of experimental data involving the tracking subpopulations of cells within a total cell population.

AB Agent based models (ABM)s are increasingly used in social science, economics, mathematics, biology and computer science to describe time dependent systems in circumstances where a description in terms of equations is difficult. Yet few tools are currently available for the systematic analysis of ABM behaviour. Numerical continuation and bifurcation analysis is a well-established tool for the study of deterministic systems. Recently, equation free (EF) methods have been developed to extend numerical continuation techniques to systems where the dynamics are described at a microscopic scale and continuation of a macroscopic property of the system is considered. To date, the practical use of EF methods has been limited by; (1) the over-head of application-specific implementation; (2) the laborious configuration of problem-specific parameters; and (3) large ensemble sizes (potentially) leading to computationally restrictive run-times.
   In this paper we address these issues with our tool for the EF continuation of stochastic systems, which includes algorithms to systematically configuration problem specific parameters and enhance robustness to noise. Our tool is generic and can be applied to any 'black-box' simulator and determines the essential EF parameters prior to EF analysis. Robustness is significantly improved using our convergence-constraint with a corrector repeat ((CR)-R-3) method. This algorithm automatically detects outliers based on the dynamics of the underlying system enabling both an order of magnitude reduction in ensemble size and continuation of systems at much higher levels of noise than classical approaches.
   We demonstrate our method with application to several ABM models, revealing parameter dependence, bifurcation and stability analysis of these complex systems giving a deep understanding of the dynamical behaviour of the models in a way that is not otherwise easily obtainable. In each case we demonstrate our systematic parameter determination stage for configuring the system specific EF parameters. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ecological restoration, particularly in urban contexts, is a complex collective decision-making process that involves a diversity of stakeholders and experts, each with their own perceptions and preferences about what landscapes should and can look like, how to get them to the desired state, and on what timeline. We investigate how structural and behavioral factors may influence collective decision making in the context of ecological restoration, with the purpose of establishing general relationships between management styles (defined by structural and behavioral factors of the organization) and decision outcomes. Informed by existing literature on collective decision making and by empirical data from the Chicago Wilderness region, we present a stylized agent-based model that maps out and simulates the processes by which individuals within restoration organizations communicate, discuss, and ultimately make a decision. Our study examines how structural and behavioral characteristics-including: (a) the number of actors and groups involved in decision making, (b) the frequency and type of interactions among actors, (c) the initial setup of positions and respect, (d) outside information, and (e) entrenchment and cost of dissent-lead to or prohibit group convergence in terms of collective position, variation in position across actors, and final decision strategies. We found that formal meetings and group leaders are important facilitators of convergence, especially when multiple groups are present, new information is introduced in the process, and participants are polarized around an issue. Also, intergroup interactions are particularly important for overall convergence. Position entrenchment slows the convergence process and increases the need for decision strategies involving outside intervention. Cost of dissent can reinforce these effects. Our study formalizes collective decision-making processes within the context of ecological restoration, establishes generalizable relationships between these processes and decision outcomes, and provides a foundation for further empirical and modeling research.

AB In order to address the problem of dust pollution formed during coal production processes, we chemically modified sodium alginate (SA), an environmentally friendly macromolecule polymer, to achieve a grafted product. IR and NMR were employed to investigate the structure of the grafted products. A contact angle experiment was used to select surfactants with good wettability, which were subsequently combined with the water-retaining agent CMS and SAE-XG-3, to fabricate an environmentally friendly dust suppressant. A high-resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to analyze the morphology of the cured film that formed on the surface of coal dust. A spraying test was performed to measure the dust suppressant's performance. The experimental results demonstrated that the environmentally friendly dust suppressant possessed good water retention, viscosity, and wettability, and could achieve suitable dust bonding and settlement performance. In addition, the newly developed dust suppressant is environmentally friendly and has economic benefits. (C) 2019 The Society of Powder Technology Japan.

AB This paper investigates the distributed fixed-time consensus-based formation tracking problems for multiple nonholonomic wheeled mobile robots under a directed interaction topology. The distributed fixed-time consensus-based controllers under the directed interaction topology are proposed for the multiple wheeled mobile robots with nonholonomic constraints, which can guarantee the group of robots converge to a predefined formation pattern with its centroid moving along the predefined reference trajectory in a fixed time. The fixed-time formation tracking can be achieved within a fixed settling time, which is independent of the initial states of the whole system. Moreover, the conditions of formation stability control are analysed by utilising graph and Lyapunov stability theories. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed distributed controllers is verified by numerical simulation.

AB Catalytic hydrodeoxygenations of furfural, guaiacol, and their mixture at different concentrations were carried out over a Ni/SiO2 catalyst to study the kinetic and competitive effects. Anisole was also studied to compare with the effects of guaiacol. Additionally, kinetic parameters were adjusted through mathematical modeling to explain the mixture behavior, and density functional theory (DFT) simulations were carried out to study the effect observed in the present work. The use of guaiacol and anisole in the mixture produces an increase in the reaction rate of furfural. Furthermore, guaiacol slightly generates a change in the selectivity of furfural products, attributed to its hydroxyl group, as such a change was not observed with anisole. DFT studies showed that the hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl group of guaiacol migrated to furfural. Both effects would be enhanced by increasing the guaiacol concentration, which could act as a stabilizing agent inhibiting the coke formation in the furfural reaction.

AB This paper studies the attitude synchronization control problem for a group of spacecraft. Considering inertia uncertainties and external disturbances with unknown bounds, a decentralized adaptive control scheme is developed using nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode (NFTSM). A multispacecraft NFTSM is firstly designed, which contains the advantages of the nonsingular terminal sliding mode and the traditional linear sliding mode together. Then, the continuous decentralized adaptive NFTSM control laws with boundary layer by employing NFTSM associated with novel adaptive architecture are proposed, which can eliminate the chattering, and guarantee the attitude tracking errors converge to the regions containing the origin in finite time. At last, numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed control strategy.

AB Simulation study on evacuation scenarios has gained tremendous attention in recent years. Two major research challenges remain along this direction: (1) how to portray the effect of individuals' adaptive behaviors under various situations in the evacuation procedures and (2) how to simulate complex evacuation scenarios involving huge crowds at the individual level due to the ultrahigh complexity of these scenarios. In this study, a simulation framework for general evacuation scenarios has been developed. Each individual in the scenario is modeled as an adaptable and autonomous agent driven by a weight-based decision-making mechanism. The simulation is intended to characterize the individuals' adaptable behaviors, the interactions among individuals, among small groups of individuals, and between the individuals and the environment. To handle the second challenge, this study adopts GPGPU to sustain massively parallel modeling and simulation of an evacuation scenario. An efficient scheme has been proposed to minimize the overhead to access the global system state of the simulation process maintained by the GPU platform. The simulation results indicate that the "adaptability" in individual behaviors has a significant influence on the evacuation procedure. The experimental results also exhibit the proposed approach's capability to sustain complex scenarios involving a huge crowd consisting of tens of thousands of individuals.

   attractiveness; meme persistence
ID DYNAMICS
AB The propagation of memes on online social networks often depends on the mechanism of social affirmation. Centola termed such social-affirmation-driven diffusion as complex contagion and partly validated it through an online experiment. However, for actual online meme propagation, the mechanism of social affirmation often takes effect in combination with various other factors and mechanisms. In this paper, we examine the combinatorial effects of social affirmation and the attractiveness and persistence of the meme by proposing and analyzing a UACI model, where an agent's activities to receive and transfer a meme is associated with the transition between its four possible states of "Uninformed", "Attended", "Convinced" and "Immune". The numerical simulations illustrate nontrivial patterns of propagation. Especially, it is revealed that the effects of simple and complex contagions co-exist and equilibrate in accordance with the joint functions of meme attractiveness and social affirmation. Furthermore, the low-persistence of the meme hinders the propagation-scale more remarkably on the regular network than on the random one, indicating that the persistence may be critical for retaining complex contagion.

ID CROSS-LINKING POLYMERIZATION
AB To-study the gelation process of weak gel and apply weak gel for the industrial practice of tertiary oil recovery, three dimensional Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to obtain the growth of average molecular weights and gel growth images. It is found that the initial polymer concentration is critical for the gel formation. The dismutation process of sol-gel groups is clearly observed. The relationship between the speed of gelation and the concentration of crosslink agent was also simulated. The predicted dependency of the gel time upon the concentration of crosslink agent is in good agreement with the experimental data of viscosity versus time. Also, the polymer concentration effects agree well with viscosity data. The simulation correctly predicts that the concentration effect on crosslink reaction will be weaker at the higher polymer concentration.

AB The reduction of CO2 emission from the ironmakmg process is important issue from the view of environmental problems typified by global warming in recent years. Low RAR (reducing agent rate) operation of the blast furnace is one of effective measures for reducing CO2 emission. Injection of HRA (hydrogenous reducing agents) from the tuyere (where is the lower part of blast furnace) is also effective measure. In this study, the influence of HRA injection point on combustion and gasification efficiency of pulvenzed coal (PC) in the case of simultaneous injection of HRA and PC from double-channel lance was examined by small scale combustion furnace and three-dimensional numencal simulation for improvement permeability in blast furnace. Combustion experimental conditions were in three cases, casel: injected HRA from outer side and PC from inner side of double-channel lance, case2: injected HRA from inner side and PC from outer side of double-channel lance and case3: injected HRA and PC premixed. As a result, the combustion and gasification efficiency was increase m the order of case3, case2 and casel. The rate of combustion and gasification of PC was investigated in casel. Not only the oxidation reaction was also accelerated CO2 and H2O gasification reaction m the case of simultaneous injection HRA and PC. A three-dimensional numerical simulation of the experimental furnace was conducted, we confirmed the increase of combustion temperature, the acceleration of oxygen consumption and gasification reaction as with the experimental results in the case of simultaneous injection HRA and PC.

AB Purpose The purpose of this study was to characterize the individual contribution of multiple fat peaks to the measured chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) signal when using water-selective binomial-pulse excitation and to determine the effects of multiple fat peaks in the presence of B-0 inhomogeneity. Methods The excitation profiles of multiple binomial pulses were simulated. A CEST sequence with binomial-pulse excitation and modified point-resolved spectroscopy localization was then applied to the in vivo lumbar spinal vertebrae to determine the signal contributions of three distinct groups of lipid resonances. These confounding signal contributions were measured as a function of the irradiation frequency offset to determine the effect of the multi-peak nature of the fat signal on CEST imaging of exchange sites (at 1.0, 2.0 and 3.5 ppm) and robustness in the presence of B-0 inhomogeneity. Results Numerical simulations and in vivo experiments showed that water excitation (WE) using a 1-3-3-1 (WE-4) pulse provided the broadest signal suppression, which provided partial robustness against B-0 inhomogeneity effects. Confounding fat signal contributions to the CEST contrasts at 1.0, 2.0 and 3.5 ppm were unavoidable due to the multi-peak nature of the fat signal. However, these CEST sites only suffer from small lipid artifacts with increment B-0 spanning roughly from - 50 to 50 Hz. Especially for the CEST site at 3.5 ppm, the lipid artifacts are smaller than 1% with increment B-0 in this range. Conclusion In WE-4-based CEST magnetic resonance imaging, B-0 inhomogeneity is the limiting factor for fat suppression. The CEST sites at 1.0, 2.0 ppm and 3.5 ppm unavoidably suffer from lipid artifacts. However, when the increment B-0 is confined to a limited range, these CEST sites are only affected by small lipid artifacts, which may be ignorable in some cases of clinical applications.

Our studies permitted to determine how the tails anchor in the peripheral site of sarin-inhibited human AChE, and which aminoacids are important to their stabilization. Also the energy values obtained in the docking studies corroborated quite well with the experimental results obtained before for these oximes.

New actors (birth) are assumed to replace individuals that abandon the community (deaths). This dynamics is simulated in the framework of a simplified model that accounts for mutual affinity between agents. A rich phenomenology is presented and discussed with reference to the original (closed group) setting. Numerical findings are supported by analytical calculations.

AB Thymidylate synthase (TS) is the molecular target of fluoropyrimidine (FP) chemotherapy, and novel anticancer drugs effective against TS-overexpressing tumors are required to treat patients with FP-refractory solid tumors. We have evaluated the inhibition of cell proliferation in vitro and antitumor activity in vivo of FdUMP[10], an oligodeoxynucleotide 10mer in which 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is the only nucleobase. FdUMP[10] is a pro-drug of FdUMP, the TS inhibitory metabolite of FPs. FdUMP[10] was 338-fold more potent than 5-FU at inhibiting cell proliferation in the NCI 60 cell line screen. The antitumor activity of FdUMP[10] was compared to 5-FU using H-T29 xenografts in female CD-I athymic (nu+/nu+) mice. Treatment with FdUMP[10] as a single agent (40 mg/kg/daily x 5, i.v.) delayed tumor growth and resulted in a smaller mean tumor size (T/C value = 5 1 %, p<0.001 compared with the control group). Treatment with 5-FU (25 mg/kg/daily x 5, i.p.) had similar results as single agent FdUMP[10] (T/C value = 65%, p=0.238 compared with the FdUMP[10] treated group. Simultaneous treatment of tumor-bearing mice with both drugs (FdUMP[10] plus 5-FU) further delayed tumor growth (T/C value = 36%; p=0.003 relative to 5-FU). The results from the combined treatment group were not, however, statistically significant relative to the group receiving single agent FdUMP[10] treatment (p=0.059). Histological examination revealed systemic damage was limited to the colonic epithelium in all treatment groups and was least extensive with single agent FdUMP[10] compared to the other treatment groups. The data support the concept that FdUMP[10] is a useful prototype of a novel type of FP that is likely to be more efficacious than FPs in clinical use.

AB Ascorbic acid (AA) and copper have been increasingly employed in flow cytometry (FCM) and high content analysis (HCA) since the introduction of click chemistry as a non-destructive alternative to classical 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) immunodetection for DNA synthesis and proliferation assays. Mixtures of ascorbate and catalytic copper, under certain experimental conditions, act as oxidizing agent, catalyzing the formation of reactive hydroxyl radicals through hydrogen peroxides decomposition via Fenton reaction. We developed a procedure for BrdU incorporation detection based on the use of AA and cupric ions as DNA damaging agents. Optimal DNA damaging conditions were identified and found to provide results comparable with click 5-ethynyl-deoxyuridine (EdU) cycloaddition approach and classical BrdU immunodetection. Scavenger agents were found to prevent hydroxyl-induced DNA damages, providing the proof-of-concept for the use of this procedure for DNA denaturation prior to BrdU detection. We demonstrated hydroxyl radicals' reaction to be readily applicable to HCA and FCM assays, for both classical BrdU immunostaining and EdU cycloaddition procedure. This technique was successfully employed for BrdU pulse-chase experiments and in multiparametric immunofluorescence assays for the simultaneous detection of labile phosphoproteins in intact cells. The use of AA/Cu prior to immunodetection for BrdU incorporation assays is a viable alternative to chemical/physical DNA denaturing agents (acids or heat), since it allows preservation of labile epitopes such as phosphoproteins, and over enzymatic agents (digestion with DNases) for its lower cost.

AB Behavioral intervention strategies have yet to become successful in the development of initiatives to foster pro-environmental behaviors in buildings. In this paper, we explored the potentials of increasing the effectiveness of requests aiming to promote pro-environmental behaviors by engaging users in a social dialog, given the effects of two possible personas that are more related to the buildings (i.e., building vs. building manager). We tested our hypotheses and evaluated our findings in virtual and physical environments and found similar effects in both environments. Our results showed that social dialog involvement persuaded respondents to perform more pro-environmental actions. However, these effects were significant when the requests were delivered by an agent representing the building. In addition, these strategies were not equally effective across all types of people and their effects varied for people with different characteristics. Our findings provide useful design choices for persuasive technologies aiming to promote pro-environmental behaviors.

AB CIOPS (Cognitive Inter-organizational Production System) is an agent-based model that integrates industry structural aspects and agents' cognitive characteristics. A demand-driven industry, whose profitability depends on the quality of suppliers' products, is represented by a three-stage vertically integrated industry. Four types of decision-making patterns are analyzed and confronted each other: from the simplest one (random choice) to the most complex one, which includes direct and indirect experience and reputation. They operate as selection devices supporting agents to select the best suppliers. Requiring agents' communication, indirect experience and reputation could be influenced by eventual opportunist behaviors. As the disturbing effect of falsity depends also on the size of decision and information space, the CIOPS model simulates different situations. Even though submitted to some restrictive assumptions, by testing five groups of hypotheses CIOPS model enables to fix many points that could be tested by empirical data and further developed by relaxing the assumptions. Results show that, especially in presence of reputation-based trust, cheating attitude severely damages industry profitability and the enlargement of information space dramatically strengthens the negative effects. Though indirect experience and reputation-based trust are powerful tools to improve industry profitability, when people cheat they dramatically reverses its effects. A sharp performance diversity is also evidenced between industry segments, because firms in the first tiers segment, who are also the suppliers of final producers, perform much better and more efficiently than final producers. Though industry size growth determines the negative effect of reducing performance, it produces the positive effect of shortening the time to reach the highest profitability and to stabilize it. Finally, it is also demonstrated that cheating half times determines almost the same negative impact of cheating always.

AB Objective. Many cytotoxic cancer therapeutic drugs activate stress response signaling pathways that transcriptionally activate a variety of genes. We decided to determine if cytotoxic therapies induce inflammatory cytokines with inhibitory effects on hematopoiesis and if lisofylline (LSF), a novel antiinflammatory compound, suppresses this induction.
   Materials and Methods. Mice were treated with cytosine beta-d-arabinofuranoside (AraC), cisplatinum(II)diammine-dichloride (CisP), etoposide (VF-16), or melphalan at clinically relevant doses, with or without LSF,
   Results. Spleen cell conditioned media (CM) derived from mice treated with cytotoxic agents, but not from control or LSF treated mice, reduced colony formation by murine hone marrow progenitors belonging to the myeloid, erythroid, megakaryocytic, and beta-lymphoid lineages, LSF (100 mg/kg), administered either simultaneously with or up to 48 hours before the cytotoxic agents, suppressed the release of this inhibitory activity. Treatment of inhibitory Chi with neutralizing antibodies against known growth inhibitory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, transforming growth factor beta, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha, resulted in enhanced colony growth.
   Conclusion. We conclude that treatment of mice with chemotherapeutic drugs induces the ex vivo production of multilineage hematopoietic inhibitors and that induction of these Inhibitors could be abrogated by treatment with LSF. These findings suggest a mechanism whereby I,SF can accelerate recovery of hematopoiesis following cytotoxic therapies, (C) 2000 International Society for Experimental Hematology.

AB Chronic pain after surgery limits social activity, interferes with work, and causes emotional suffering. A major component of such pain is reported as resting or spontaneous pain with no apparent external stimulus. Although experimental animal models can simulate the stimulus-evoked chronic pain that occurs after surgery, there have been no studies of spontaneous chronic pain in such models. Here the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm was used to reveal resting pain after experimental thoracotomy. Male Sprague Dawley rats received a thoracotomy with 1-hour rib retraction, resulting in evoked tactile hypersensitivity, previously shown to last for at least 9 weeks. Intraperitoneal injections of morphine (2.5 mg/kg) or gabapentin (40 mg/kg) gave equivalent 2- to 3-hour-long relief of tactile hypersensitivity when tested 12 to 14 days postoperatively. In separate experiments, single trial CPP was conducted 1 week before thoracotomy and then 12 days (gabapentin) or 14 days (morphine) after surgery, followed the next day by 1 conditioning session with morphine or gabapentin, both versus saline. The gabapentin-conditioned but not the morphine-conditioned rats showed a significant preference for the analgesia-paired chamber, despite the equivalent effect of the 2 agents in relieving tactile allodynia. These results show that experimental thoracotomy in rats causes spontaneous pain and that some analgesics, such as morphine, that reduce evoked pain do not also relieve resting pain, suggesting that pathophysiological mechanisms differ between these 2 aspects of long-term postoperative pain.
   Perspective: Spontaneous pain, a hallmark of chronic postoperative pain, is demonstrated here in a rat model of experimental postthoracotomy pain, further validating the use of this model for the development of analgesics to treat such symptoms. Although stimulus-evoked pain was sensitive to systemic morphine, spontaneous pain was not, suggesting different mechanistic underpinnings. (C) 2015 by the American Pain Society

AB Many nonhuman animals preferentially copy the actions of others when the environment contains predation risk or other types of danger. In humans, the role of social learning in avoidance of danger is still unknown, despite the fundamental importance of social learning for complex social behaviors. Critically, many social behaviors, such as cooperation and adherence to religious taboos, are maintained by threat of punishment. However, the psychological mechanisms allowing threat of punishment to generate such behaviors, even when actual punishment is rare or absent, are largely unknown. To address this, we used both computer simulations and behavioral experiments. First, we constructed a model where simulated agents interacted under threat of punishment and showed that mechanisms' (a) tendency to copy the actions of others through social learning, together with (b) the rewarding properties of avoiding a threatening punishment, could explain the emergence, maintenance, and transmission of large-scale behavioral traditions, both when punishment is common and when it is rare or nonexistent. To provide empirical support for our model, including the 2 mechanisms, we conducted 4 experiments, showing that humans, if threatened with punishment, are exceptionally prone to copy and transmit the behavior observed in others. Our results show that humans, similar to many nonhuman animals, use social learning if the environment is perceived as dangerous. We provide a novel psychological and computational basis for a range of human behaviors characterized by the threat of punishment, such as the adherence to cultural norms and religious taboos.

AB The reduction of CO2 emission from the ironmaking process is an important issue from the view of environmental problems typified by global warming in recent years. Low RAR (reducing agent rate) operation of the blast furnace is one of effective methods for reducing CO2 emission. Injection of HRA (hydrogenous reducing agents) from the tuyere (where is the lower part of a blast furnace) is also effective measure. In this study, the influence of HRA injection point on combustion and gasification efficiency of pulverized coal (PC) in the case of simultaneous injection of HRA and PC from double-channel lance was examined by small scale combustion furnace and three-dimensional numerical simulation for permeability in the blast furnace. Combustion experimental conditions were in three cases, case 1: injected HRA from the outer side and PC from the inner side of double-channel lance, case 2: injected HRA from inner side and PC from outer side of double-channel lance and case 3: injected HRA and PC premixed. As a result, the combustion and gasification efficiency was increased in. the order of case 1, case 2 and case 3. The rate of combustion and gasification of PC was investigated in case'. Not only the oxidation reaction was also accelerated CO2 and H2O gasification reaction in the case of simultaneous injection HRA and PC. A three-dimensional numerical simulation of the experimental furnace was conducted, we confirmed the increase of combustion temperature, the acceleration of oxygen consumption and gasification reaction as with the experimental results in the case of simultaneous injection HRA and PC.

AB Service robots that mimic human social behavior can appear polite. We tested the social and behavioral efficacy and legibility of two kinesic courtesy cues on people's approval of a service robot. In a repeated-measures design, 29 volunteers were randomly assigned to two test situations: A participant and the robot simultaneously approached a bottleneck either next to each other or from opposite ends. Nested within these two situations were three courtesy cue conditions: The robot moved without any explicit courtesy cues, stopped, or moved aside and then stopped. We found statistically significant effects of the courtesy cues on people's self-reported appreciation and the legibility of the robot's motion. Behavioral observations indicated that the robot exhibiting two courtesy cues was less disruptive to the human's own actions and was thus more behaviorally effective. This research demonstrates that kinesic politeness cues can be used effectively in the motion design of service robots.

AB Reputation plays a key role among the mechanisms supporting cooperation in our society. This is a well-known observation and, in fact, several studies have shown that reputation may substantially increase cooperation among subjects playing Prisoner's Dilemma games in the laboratory. Unfortunately, recent experiments indicate that when reputation can be faked cooperation can still be maintained at the expense of honest subjects who are deceived by the dishonest ones. As experimental work is limited due to financial and other reasons, we present here an agent-based simulation model inspired by, and calibrated against, the results obtained in the experiment. We thus simulate much larger population sizes over longer times, and test other model parameters to see whether the observed behavior generalizes in those yet untried conditions. The results show that the collective behavior is qualitatively similar in larger systems and stable over longer times horizons. We conclude that the findings of the experimental work are meaningful, taking into account that the model is strictly tailored to our particular experimental setting and therefore it is a possible explanation of our observations whose applicability to other contexts requires further research. We argue that simulations like the ones presented here may also be useful to cheaply and quickly suggest settings and options to enhance and facilitate further experiments, which, in turn, may provide new tests of the models themselves.

AB Under the background of China as a big coal-hungry country lasting till 2050, deep mining becomes more and more significant. However, deep coal seams usually have a very complex geological structure like Karst collapse columns, and excavation is often accompanied with water-inrush accidents, restricting the development of the coal industry. In order to study on seepage problems on fractured rock accompanying with mass loss during excavation in coal mines with karst collapse columns, researchers studied on water-inrush mechanism in karst collapse columns directly, researched on seepage behavior of fractured rock with pressure as the basis of studying on water-inrush mechanism indirectly, studied the fluid flow change in fractured rock regarding the change of liquid flow type in fractured rock as seepage instability, and observed and studied the phenomenon of mass loss during seepage in succession. In the following research, (1) the cementation, lithology, and match rate of testing samples, which are the foundation of the simulation study, need to be determined in more detail; (2) migrated particles in fractured rock should be distributed which are from migration, corrosion, erosion, and abrasion; (3) multi-permeate agents in the fractured geological structure, their diffusion and convection, and the related chemical reactions should be involved; (4) more and more contemporary mathematical methods will be introduced to help us to study the complex dynamic system; and (5) experimental equipment needs to be designed and improved. What we did before, do now, and will do later is to penetrate the mysteries of seepage problems on fractured rock accompanying with mass loss during excavation in coal mines with karst collapse columns.

AB Land-use change in the US Great Plains since agricultural settlement in the second half of the nineteenth century has been well documented. While aggregate historical trends are easily tracked, the decision making of individual farmers is difficult to reconstruct. We use an agent-based model to tell the history of the settlement of the west by simulating farm-level agricultural decision making based on historical data about prices, yields, farming costs, and environmental conditions. The empirical setting for the model is the period between 1875 and 1940 in two townships in Kansas, one in the shortgrass region and the other in the mixed grass region. Annual historical data on yields and prices determine profitability of various land uses and thereby inform decision making, in conjunction with the farmer's previous experience and randomly assigned levels of risk aversion. Results illustrating the level of agreement between model output and a unique and detailed set of household-level records of historical land use and farm size suggest that economic behavior and natural endowments account for land change processes to some degree, but are incomplete. Discrepancies are examined to identify missing processes through model experiments, in which we adjust input and output prices, crop yields, agent memory, and risk aversion. These analyses demonstrate that how agent-based modeling can be a useful laboratory for thinking about social and economic behavior in the past.

AB Sulfur mustard (SM) is an incapacitating chemical warfare agent used in numerous conflicts around the world and it is still a major threat for both, army troops and civilians. To evaluate its multiple targets effects in experimental setup, a model of whole body exposure (WBE) to SM vapor was established in rats and its simultaneous effects on lungs and eyes as well as on general wellbeing were examined. Rats were exposed to SM vapor. Evaluation (up to 10 weeks post-exposure) included body weight, general observation, blood counts and histological analysis. Results showed that following a latency-period of several hours, rats typical symptoms developed over a period of more than one week. The initial symptoms, characterized by swollen and erythematic nose, deteriorated into extensive rhinorrhea, eye closure, excessive lacrimation as well as rhonchi, wheezing and breathing difficulties. Alopecia and behavioral abnormality were also recorded. A weight loss of up to 40% was measured within one week with spontaneous recovery to baseline level within three weeks after exposure. Blood counts revealed leukopenia during the first three days post-exposure. Histological evaluation revealed a long lasting damage to the trachea, lungs and eyes. Thus, WBE to SM, was found to closely mimic the deleterious effects of SM on the sensitive tissues previously described in human victims during WWI and the Iran-Iraq war. The use of this animal model will enable comprehensive characterization of changes in biological processes that may lead to the development of therapeutic measures to ameliorate SM induced multi-system injuries.

LA English
DT Article
DE Energy-Use; Goal-Framing; Social Networks; Values
ID SOCIAL NETWORKS; BEHAVIOR; ADOPTION; VALUES
AB The CEDSS-3.4 agent-based model of domestic energy demand at community level is described. CEDSS (Community Energy Demand Social Simulator) is focused on household decisions (the model's agents are households) to buy energy-using appliances, heating systems, and insulation, over the period from 2000 to 2049. Its empirical basis is a survey of households in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire, Scotland, carried out in 2010, combined with publicly available data on household finances and equipment, and energy prices. CEDSS3.4 emphasises mechanisms concerning value-strength dynamics and goal selection which influence such decisions, drawing on goal-framing theory. Results of experiments with the model are presented; the most important parameters for determining energy demand turn out to be economic (rates of change of incomes and of fuel prices), and the presence or absence of external (extra-community) influences on value-strengths. However, the value-strength dynamics used led in most runs to a single set of values dominating the population by 2049 a AS but even with identical parameters, different sets of values could become dominant, and which did so made a very considerable difference to demand. This resulted in bimodal distributions of outcome measures across the runs using a given parameter-setting in many cases; initial experiments indicated that changing parameters determining how far households influence each others' values could at least reduce this tendency. Issues in the analysis of complex models with aspects unconstrained by either data or theory are discussed in the final section.

DE pulverized coal gasification; Euler-Lagrangian model; swirling jet; CFD
AB In order to study the influence of the swirling jet of the gasification agent on coal gasification performance, the gasification process of Ningdong pulverized coal inside a GSP gasifier (2000 t/d) was simulated under hot conditions, and the results were compared with actual industrial parameters. A three-dimensional steady multi-phase turbulent flow model was established by ANSYS Fluent. The coupling effect of turbulent chemistry was considered by Species Transport model. The realizable k-E model was used for the gas phase flow. The P-1 model was implemented for radiation heat transfer. The heterogeneous reactions were irreversible surface reactions and the gas phase reactions were to reach equilibrium. The numerical results showed detailed information of flow field under direct jet and swirling jet. It indicated the swirling jet had a significant influence on coal gasification performance by analyzing the characteristics of flame, species, and gas-solid distribution. In other words, the swirling jet promotes the reaction efficiency between coal particles and gas phase, increases the residence time of pulverized coal, and temperature and species concentration distribution are more well-distributed. Furthermore, this work can better predict coal gasification behaviour under different conditions, so as to provide the theoretic support for subsequent sulphur removal and optimal design of the gasifier.

ID AGENT-BASED SIMULATION; HEAVY DRINKING; ROLES; TRANSITIONS; MARRIAGE
AB The generative approach to social science, in which agent-based simulations (or other complex systems models) are executed to reproduce a known social phenomenon, is an important tool for realist explanation. However, a generative model, when suitably calibrated and validated using empirical data, represents just one viable candidate set of entities and mechanisms. The model only partially addresses the needs of an abductive reasoning process-specifically it does not provide insight into other viable sets of entities or mechanisms nor suggests which of these are fundamentally constitutive for the phenomenon to exist. In this paper, we propose a new model discovery framework that more fully captures the needs of realist explanation. The framework exploits the implicit ontology of an existing human-built generative model to propose and test a plurality of new candidate model structures. Genetic programming is used to automate this search process. A multiobjective approach is used, which enables multiple perspectives on the value of any particular generative model-such as goodness of fit, parsimony, and interpretability-to be represented simultaneously. We demonstrate this new framework using a complex systems modeling case study of change and stasis in societal alcohol use patterns in the US over the period 1980-2010. The framework is successful in identifying three competing explanations of these alcohol use patterns, using novel integrations of social role theory not previously considered by the human modeler. Practitioners in complex systems modeling should use model discovery to improve the explanatory utility of the generative approach to realist social science.

AB Humans use social information to improve their decisions in scenarios that involve uncertainty. Previous research has shown that this social influence can have positive or negative outcomes depending on the context of decision and characteristics of the system. A particular scenario where the social information matters is the collective escape where behaviour of others could be used as an extra source of information and thus, influence the decision-making. The question is whether there could be any benefit for escaping human crowds to display imitative tendencies (or the so-called 'herd' behaviour) in their decision making. Here, we investigate this question in relation to exit direction decision-making through extensive computer simulation analyses. Using parameteric models of decision making, we increased the imitative tendency of (behaviourally) homogenous crowds on a continuum, simulated the escape process and outputted measures of system efficiency. We examined a broad range of simulated scenarios in terms of the shape of the environment, exit visibility and spatial distribution of exit capacities. Results showed that for none of the scenarios we tested, the escaping crowd could benefit from amplified tendencies to imitate peers. Our numerical analyses suggested that, at least when familiar with escape routes, there is no rationale for blindly following the direction choices of the crowd in emergency scenarios. Strong tendency to copy direction choices of the crowd could substantially hinder the process of evacuations and increase the risk of casualty. These findings have potential implications for evacuation training guidlines. They provide insights into how individuals should be guided/instructed to conduct themselves in case of an emergency in order to facilitate and optimise the evacuation process. A question for future research is how imitation (herding) in other aspects of escape behaviour (such as movement initiation or adapting (changing) direction choices) can influence the system.

AB This paper addresses the problem of distributed prescribed-time attitude cooperative control for a group of spacecraft subject to bounded external disturbances. Since the desired attitude is only available to a subset of spacecraft, a distributed prescribed-time observer is designed to estimate the desired attitude. Based on the desired attitude observer, a distributed prescribed-time attitude cooperative controller is designed to make the attitude of each spacecraft track cooperatively the desired attitude though only a subset of spacecraft can access the desired attitude. The Lyapunov stability theorem is employed to validate that the attitude tracking is achieved in a prescribed time under the control scheme. Finally, the results of numerical simulation are presented to show the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed control scheme. (C) 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Previously, passive cavitation imaging has been described in the context of continuous-wave high-intensity focused ultrasound thermal ablation. However, the technique has potential use as a feedback mechanism for pulsed-wave therapies, such as ultrasound-mediated drug delivery. In this paper, results of experiments and simulations are reported to demonstrate the feasibility of passive cavitation imaging using pulsed ultrasound insonations and how the images depend on pulsed ultrasound parameters. The passive cavitation images were formed from channel data that was beamformed in the frequency domain. Experiments were performed in an in vitro flow phantom with an experimental echo contrast agent, echogenic liposomes, as cavitation nuclei. It was found that the pulse duration and envelope have minimal impact on the image resolution achieved. The passive cavitation image amplitude scales linearly with the cavitation emission energy. Cavitation images for both stable and inertial cavitation can be obtained from the same received data set. (C) 2012 Acoustical Society of America.

AB Purpose: Microbubble contrast agents are currently implemented in a variety of both clinical and preclinical ultrasound imaging studies. The therapeutic and diagnostic capabilities of these contrast agents are limited by their short in-vivo lifetimes, and research to lengthen their circulation times is on going. In this manuscript, observations are presented from a controlled experiment performed to evaluate differences in circulation times for lipid shelled perfluorocarbon-filled contrast agents circulating within rodents as a function of inhaled anesthesia carrier gas.
   Methods: The effects of two common anesthesia carrier gas selections - pure oxygen and medical air were observed within five rats. Contrast agent persistence within the kidney was measured and compared for oxygen and air anesthesia carrier gas for six bolus contrast injections in each animal. Simulations were performed to examine microbubble behavior with changes in external environment gases.
   Results: A statistically significant extension of contrast circulation time was observed for animals breathing medical air compared to breathing pure oxygen. Simulations support experimental observations and indicate that enhanced contrast persistence may be explained by reduced ventilation/perfusion mismatch and classical diffusion, in which nitrogen plays a key role by contributing to the volume and diluting other gas species in the microbubble gas core.
   Conclusion: Using medical air in place of oxygen as the carrier gas for isoflurane anesthesia can increase the circulation lifetime of ultrasound microbubble contrast agents. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB CONTEXT: In Madagascar land use pressure on natural resources has increased drastically over the last decades. For subsistence farmers this situation often leads to an accelerated unsustainable exploitation of resources with negative consequences for their livelihood, which can be described as a social-ecological trap (SET).
   OBJECTIVE: Our paper seeks to understand the dynamics of SETs and demonstrates a model-driven scenario on how farmers may escape the trap. For this, we developed a spatially explicit empirical agent-based model (SEALM) to simulate possible future trends of farmers? crop management and the effects of these trends on the environment, household (HH) economy, food self-sufficiency (FSS) and HH coping strategies to food insecurity.
   METHODS: Using links between social-ecological system (SES) components that depict real-world conditions, SEALM focuses on three village communities for which extensive data were available from transdisciplinary research comprising surveys, remote sensing analysis, and field-based validation. To identify the most significant parameters and to quantify how parameter uncertainty influences model outcomes, local and global sensitivity analyses were performed. Simulations were conducted in annual time steps from 2015 to 2045 to depict two contrasting scenarios: A baseline scenario (A) and an improved crop management scenario to increase FSS (B). For scenario assessments we used direct simulation outputs (FSS, HH income, land cover) and further indices calculated based on model outcomes (coping strategy index, landscape fragmentation, and the Gini coefficient).
   RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Scenario A predicted expansion of cropland and fragmentation of remaining forest areas. Simulations at each time step displayed how SET situations occurred due to self-reinforcing ecological and social constraints and affected HHs future coping capacity to food shortages. Here, FSS was insufficient (< 1.0) for most HHs and was <0.5 for years with rainfall deficits. Scenario B demonstrated a way to navigate out of the SET by increasing crop yields reflecting improved management and resulting in significantly higher FSS values and a lower coping strategy index. SEALM considers the heterogeneity in farmers? abilities, constraints, behaviour and decision-making and depicts the dynamic interplay of SES components contributing to SET.
   SIGNIFICANCE: SEALM serves as a discussion support with local stakeholders and experts and it allows to better tailor site specific land use recommendations due to its empirical driven and spatially explicit character. However, strategies and interventions that lower the poverty rate in the long term and encourage exit out of trap situations require major policy changes.

TI Ant aggregations self-heal to compensate for the Ringelmann effect
SO SOFT MATTER
LA English
DT Article
AB Fire ants, Solenopsis invicta, link their bodies together to form structures such as rafts, bivouacs and bridges. Such structures are in danger of being damaged by natural disturbances such as passing water currents. In this combined experimental and theoretical study, we investigate the self-healing of ant assemblages. We press two ant aggregations together and measure the forces to pull them apart. As the group size increases, the contribution of each ant decreases. This phenomenon, known as the Ringelmann effect, or social loafing, has previously been shown for cattle and humans. In this study, we show that it is a challenge for ants as well. We rationalize this effect with an agent-based simulation which exhibits the Ringelmann effect of ants that periodically make and break links with each other, but grip with higher probability if the ants are stretched. Over time, ants compensate for the Ringelmann effect by building more links. We use a mathematical model to show that the rate of new links is proportional to the number of free ants in the cluster. The principles found here may inspire new directions in self-healing and active materials.

AB Improving the foamability of anionic surfactants in hard water is essential to reduce the adding concentration and economic cost of foaming agents for dust control. In this work, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and sodium dodecyl ether sulfate (SDES) were selected to explore the mechanism of polyethylene oxide (EO) groups improving the foamability of anionic surfactants in hard water by experiments and molecular dynamics simulations. The experimental results show that SDES containing EO groups has better foaming performance in hard water compared with SDS. The simulation results indicate that the presence of EO groups can inhibit the combination of SO4- groups and Ca2+ ions at the air/water interface, which makes part of Ca2+ ions migrate from the interface layer to the bulk water. In addition, EO groups attract some Ca2+ ions to distribute around them, thereby further reducing the number of Ca2+ ions combined with SO4- groups, which helps to improve the surface activity and foamability of anionic surfactants in hard water. An increase in the number of EO groups can enlarge the interfacial thickness and the number of hydrogen bonds between surfactants and water molecules, enhancing the strength of bubble film. Moreover, the farther the EO group is from the SO4- group, the smaller the contribution to the hydration of anionic surfactants.

AB In public goods game (PGG), player's cooperative behavior is not pure economical rationality, but social preference and prosocial intuition play extremely important roles as well. Social preference and prosocial intuition can be guided by heuristics from one's neighbors in daily life. To better investigate the impacts of heuristics on the evolution of cooperation, four types of agents are introduced into our spatial PGG. Through numerical simulations, results show that the larger percentages of cooperators with independent thought, the easier emergence and maintenance of collective cooperative behaviors. Additionally, we find that differentia heuristic capability has great effect on the equilibrium of PGG. Cooperation can be obviously promoted, when heuristic capability of cooperators with independent thought is stronger than that of defectors with independent thought. Finally, we observe that cooperators with independent thought and defectors with independent thought are favorable for the formation of some high quality clusters, which can resist the invasion between each other. Our work may help us understand more clearly the mechanism of cooperation in real world. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID BEHAVIOR; AGENTS; PRICES
AB We present a cellular automaton (CA) model for simulating the complex dynamics of stock markets. Within this model, a stock market is represented by a two-dimensional lattice, of which each vertex stands for a trader. According to typical trading behavior in real stock markets, agents of only two types are adopted: fundamentalists and imitators. Our CA model is based on local interactions, adopting simple rules for representing the behavior of traders and a simple rule for price updating. This model can reproduce, in a simple and robust manner, the main characteristics observed in empirical financial time series. Heavy-tailed return distributions due to large price variations can be generated through the imitating behavior of agents. In contrast to other microscopic simulation (MS) models, our results suggest that it is not necessary to assume a certain network topology in which agents group together, e.g., a random graph or a percolation network. That is, long-range interactions can emerge from local interactions. Volatility clustering, which also leads to heavy tails, seems to be related to the combined effect of a fast and a slow process: the evolution of the influence of news and the evolution of agents' activity, respectively. In a general sense, these causes of heavy tails and volatility clustering appear to be common among some notable MS models that can confirm the main characteristics of financial markets.

   Objective. To quantify temporal and spatial changes simultaneously in spinal cord blood flow and hemorrhage during the first hour after spinal cord injury (SCI), using contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEU).
   Summary of Background Data. Post-traumatic ischemia and hemorrhage worsen the primary lesions induced by SCI. Previous studies did not simultaneously assess temporal and spatial changes in spinal cord blood flow.
   Methods. SCI was induced at Th10 in 12 animals, which were compared with 11 sham-operated controls. Spinal cord blood flow was measured in 7 adjacent regions of interest and in the sum of these 7 regions. Blood flow was quantified using CEU with intravenous microbubble injection. Spinal cord hemorrhage was measured on conventional B-mode sonogram slices.
   Results. CEU allowed us to measure the temporal and spatial changes in spinal cord blood flow in both groups. In the SCI group, spinal cord blood flow was significantly decreased in the global region of interest (P = 0.0016), at the impact site (epicenter), and in the 4 regions surrounding the epicenter, compared with the sham group. The blood flow decrease was maximum at the epicenter. No statistically significant differences between the sham groups were found for the most rostral and caudal regions of interest. Hemorrhage size increased significantly with time (P < 0.0001), from 30.3 mm(2) (+/- 2) after 5 minutes to 39.6 mm(2) (+/- 2.3) after 60 minutes.
   Conclusion. CEU seems reliable for quantifying temporal and spatial changes in spinal cord blood flow. After SCI, bleeding occurs in the spinal cord parenchyma and increases significantly throughout the first hour.

AB With the continuous worsening of water pollution, the use of various collectors to remove heavy metal ions from aqueous solutions has attracted widespread attention. In this work, an acid-resistant collector, sodium acetyldithiocarbamate (ADTC) that combines acetamide with carbon disulfide was proposed for heavy metal removal. The structure of ADTC was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer (NMR). Flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry (FAAS) was used to detect the concentration of metal ions in the solution before and after the treatment of the chelating agents. The chelation removal efficiency are compared for different chelating agents for Cu2+ and Ni2+ in acidic aqueous solution with pH = 1-7, and compared to the chelation removal efficiency of sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC) and sodium ethyl xanthate (SEX) chelating agents. The experimental results suggest the order of the chelating ability is ADTC > DDTC > SEX for Cu (2+) and Ni2+. The chelating ability of ADTC to Ni2+ is stronger than that of Cu2+. The chelating ability of the collector is greatly affected by the pH value. The ADTC has a good chelating ability in the pH range of 3-7. The molecular orbital distribution, charge and electrostatic potential surfaces in quantum chemistry are used to explore the main active sites of the chelating agent are the S atom. The results of high resolution mass spectrometry showed that the ADTC is coordinated with the positive divalent metal ion in the ratio of 2:1. According to the results, the dithioamino (-NHCSS ) groups are coordinated with the positive divalent metal ion in a 2:1 ratio. Molecular dynamics simulation is used to explore the adsorption energy and binding strength of the chelating agent on the metal surface. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we present a critical review of the current layout of alphabets on a mobile keypad and seek to improvise it for optimized text entry to facilitate user interaction with or without the use of predictive text input techniques. Currently, most mobile phones use multi-press as the preferred method of text entry though they also offer word-based disambiguation schemes. However, keypad layouts are not optimized for text entry using word based disambiguation schemes as several matches exist for the same numeric combination, some of which are frequently used words. This scheme effectively slows down text entry speeds, requiring more tapping for disambiguating matches.
   The proposed model seeks to reduce the number of matches for any possible numeric combinations, by optimization of keypad layout by repositioning alphabets on the keypad. For users not using dictionary, our model requires lesser tapping for commonly used alphabets and groups commonly used key combinations together such as in a computer keyboard. The proposed model was derived by simulation of the mobile phone keypad on a computer system and it uses cognitive agents to derive the most optimum keypad layout. Our model uses frequently used English words from a dictionary and attempts to minimize the number of matches for any given numeric key combinations, though the same could easily be duplicated for other languages. The model is expected to cause a significant rise in the text input speeds of mobile phones and other embedded devices with limited text entry capabilities, leading to better usability and customer satisfaction.

AB We model network formation as a simultaneous game of incomplete information, allowing linking decisions to depend on the structure of the network as well as the attributes of agents. When the data is rationalized by a symmetric equilibrium, meaning observationally equivalent agents choose the same ex-ante strategies, the model can be estimated using a computationally simple two-step estimator. We derive its asymptotic properties under a sequence of models sending the number of agents to infinity, which enables inference with only a single network observation. Our procedure generalizes dyadic regression, allowing the latent index to be a function of endogenous regressors that depend on the network. We apply the estimator to study trust networks in rural Indian villages. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we propose a new architecture to study artificial stock markets. This architecture rests on a mechanism called 'school' which is a procedure to map the phenotype to the genotype or, in plain English, to uncover the secret of success. We propose an agent-based model of 'school', and consider school as an evolving population driven by single-population GP (SGP). The architecture also takes into consideration traders' search behavior. By simulated annealing, traders' search density can be connected to psychological factors, such as peer pressure or economic factors such as the standard of living. This market architecture was then implemented in a standard artificial stock market. Our econometric study of the resultant artificial time series evidences that the return series is independently and identically distributed (iid), and hence supports the efficient market hypothesis (EMH). What is interesting though is that this lid series was generated by traders, who do not believe in the EMH at all. In fact, our study indicates that many of our traders were able to find useful signals quite often from business school, even though these signals were short-lived. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The combination of electric vehicles (EVs) and intermittent renewable energy sources has received increasing attention over the last few years. Not only does charging electric vehicles with renewable energy realize their true potential as a clean mode of transport, charging electric vehicles at times of peaks in renewable energy production can help large scale integration of renewable energy in the existing energy infrastructure. We present an agent-based model that investigates the potential contribution of this combination. More specifically, we investigate the potential effects of different kinds of policy interventions on aggregate EV charging patterns. The policy interventions include financial incentives, automated smart charging, information campaigns and social charging. We investigate how well the resulting charging patterns are aligned with renewable energy production and how much they affect user satisfaction of EV drivers. Where possible, we integrate empirical data in our model, to ensure realistic scenarios. We use recent theory from environmental psychology to determine agent behaviour, contrary to earlier simulation models, which have focused only on technical and financial considerations. Based on our simulation results, we articulate some policy recommendations. Furthermore, we point to future research directions for environmental psychology scholars and modelers who want to use theory to inform simulation models of energy systems.

AB Danger is a fundamental aspect of the lives of most animals. Adaptive behavior therefore requires avoiding actions, objects, and environments associated with danger. Previous research has shown that humans and non-human animals can avoid such dangers through two types of behavioral adaptions, (i) genetic preparedness to avoid certain stimuli or actions, and (ii) social learning. These adaptive mechanisms reduce the fitness costs associated with danger but still allow flexible behavior. Despite the empirical prevalence and importance of both these mechanisms, it is unclear when they evolve and how they interact. We used evolutionary agent-based simulations, incorporating empirically based learning mechanisms, to clarify if preparedness and social learning typically both evolve in dangerous environments, and if these mechanisms generally interact synergistically or antagonistically. Our simulations showed that preparedness and social learning often co-evolve because they provide complimentary benefits: genetic preparedness reduced foraging efficiency, but resulted in a higher rate of survival in dangerous environments, while social learning generally came to dominate the population, especially when the environment was stochastic. However, even in this case, genetic preparedness reliably evolved. Broadly, our results indicate that the relationship between preparedness and social learning is important as it can result in trade-offs between behavioral flexibility and safety, which can lead to seemingly suboptimal behavior if the evolutionary environment of the organism is not taken into account.

AB One hypothesis about the origins and evolution of coordinated animal movements is that they may serve as a defensive mechanism against predation. Earlier studies of the possible evolution of coordinated movement in prey concentrated on predators with simple attack tactics. Numerous studies, however, suggest that to overcome the apparent defensive mechanisms which grouping and coordinated movement may provide to prey, predators in nature appear to use elaborate target selection and pursuit/hunting tactics. We here study predators that use composite tactics, (a) predators that in successive attacks based on probability choose one of several simple attack tactics, (b) predators that first disperse prey and then pick off isolated individuals. We develop an individual based model of a group of prey that is attacked by a solitary predator agent. By using genetic algorithms, we enable the predator agent to adapt (a) the probability that a specific tactic will be selected in the next attack, (b) the distance at which it stops dispersing the prey and the radius within which it searches for the most isolated prey. With a direct competition of the evolved predator agents we examine which is the better tactic against a group of prey moving in a polarized cohesive manner in three different settings. Our results suggest that, (a) a delayed response is an efficient advanced prey defence tactic, (b) predator confusion plays an important role in the evolution of composite tactics, and (c) when confusion is at play, the dispersing predator is a much better hunter, capable of at least partially diminishing the effectiveness of the prey's delayed response.

AB In order to navigate safely and effectively with humans in close proximity, robots must be capable of predicting the future motions of humans. This study first consolidates human studies in motion, intention, and preference into a discretized human model that can readily be used in robotics decision making algorithms. Cooperative Markov Decision Process (Co-MDP), a novel framework that improves upon Multiagent MDPs, is then proposed for enabling socially aware robot obstacle avoidance. Utilizing the consolidated and discretized human model, Co-MDP allows the system to (1) approximate rational human behavior and intention, (2) generate socially-aware robotic obstacle avoidance behavior, and (3) remain robust to the uncertainty of human intention and motion variance. Simulations of a human-robot co-populated environment verify Co-MDP as a feasible obstacle avoidance algorithm. In addition, the anthropomorphic behavior of Co-MDP was assessed and confirmed with a human-in-the-loop experiment. Results reveal that participants can not directly differentiate agents that were controlled by human operators from Co-MDP, and the reported confidences of their choices indicates that the predictions from participants were backed by behavioral evidence rather than random guesses. Thus the main contributions for this paper are: consolidating past human studies of rational human behavior and intention into a simple, discretized model; the development of Co-MDP: a robotic decision framework that can utilize this human model and maximize the joint utility between the human and robot; and an experimental design for evaluation of the human acceptance of obstacle avoidance algorithms.

AB Collective behaviour is a fascinating and easily observable phenomenon, attractive to a wide range of researchers. In biology, computational models have been extensively used to investigate various properties of collective behaviour, such as: transfer of information across the group, benefits of grouping (defence against predation, foraging), group decision-making process, and group behaviour types. The question 'why,' however remains largely unanswered. Here the interest goes into which pressures led to the evolution of such behaviour, and evolutionary computational models have already been used to test various biological hypotheses. Most of these models use genetic algorithms to tune the parameters of previously presented non-evolutionary models, but very few attempt to evolve collective behaviour from scratch. Of these last, the successful attempts display clumping or swarming behaviour. Empirical evidence suggests that in fish schools there exist three classes of behaviour; swarming, milling and polarized. In this paper we present a novel, artificial lifelike evolutionary model, where individual agents are governed by linguistic fuzzy rule-based systems, which is capable of evolving all three classes of behaviour.

AB The artifice of an infinitely-lived representative agent is commonly invoked to balance the present costs and future benefits of climate stabilization policies. Since actual economies are populated by overlapping generations of finite-lived persons, this approach begs important questions of welfare aggregation. This paper compares the results of representative agent and overlapping generations models that are numerically calibrated based on standard assumptions regarding climate-economy interactions. Under two social choice rules - Pareto efficiency and classical utilitarianism - the models generate closely similar simulation results. In the absence of policies to redistribute income between present and future generations, efficient rates of carbon dioxide emissions abatement rise from 15 to 20% between the years 2000 and 2105. Under classical utilitarianism, in contrast, optimal control rates rise from 48 to 79% this same period.

AB Real life emotions are often blended and involve several simultaneous superposed or masked emotions. This paper reports on a study on the perception of multimodal emotional behaviors in Embodied Conversational Agents. This experimental study aims at evaluating if people detect properly the signs of emotions in different modalities (speech, facial expressions, gestures) when they appear to be superposed or masked. We compared the perception of emotional behaviors annotated in a corpus of TV interviews and replayed by an expressive agent at different levels of abstraction. The results provide insights on the use of such protocols for studying the effect of various models and modalities on the perception of complex emotions.
